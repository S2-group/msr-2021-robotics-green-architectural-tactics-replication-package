By providing a  connection, rosbridge server allows webpages to talk ROS using the rosbridge protocol. Rosbridge server creates a  connection and passes any JSON messages from the  to rosbridge_library, so rosbridge library can convert the JSON strings into ROS calls. The reverse also happens, with rosbridge library converting any ROS responses into JSON, then passing it to rosbridge server to send over the  connection. Check out  for a  library that talks to rosbridge server over . While rosbridge server provides a  connection, rosbridge itself is not tied to any particular transport layer.

 Dependent on the order of rotation axes, there are different sets of Euler angles. One common set is roll-pitch-yaw (the default in ROS), which corresponds to rotations about x, y, and z axes w.r.t. the fixed frame. To specify Euler angles w.r.t. a different set or order of axes, simply specify the desired order instead of rpy.

To specify whether rotations should be performed w.r.t. the tatic or the moving / otationg frame (corresponding to left resp. right matrix multiplication), it's possible to prefix the axes order by """" or """".

  is a Python module that is both a library to communicate to devices through the  class, and a standalone script to configure such a device. Note that you can use the module in an interactive session to diagnose or configure the device with a bit more flexibility.  Changing the baudrate to values other than 115200 might not work for some devices (despite mentioned in the vendor documentation) and might require the emergency procedure to recover communication with the device. 

This package provides a driver for the third and fourth generation of Xsens IMU devices. The driver is in two parts, a small implementation of most of the MT protocol in Python and a . It works both on serial and USB interfaces. These MT* devices can store their configuration and will retrieve it at each boot and then stream data according to this configuration. The node only forwards the data streamed onto ROS topics. In order to configure your device, you can use the  script (or the vendor tool on Windows). Compared to the other MTi drivers ( and ), this one can handle other configurations than the default and the GPS module of the MTi-G. It is also a clean rewrite of the communication protocol easier to maintain (and possibly extend) than the old vendor based multi-layered architecture. The ROS node is a wrapper around the  class to publish the data that the IMU streams. It can publish the following topics, depending on the configuration of the device (topics are only advertised when there is data to publish): 
It also publishes  information. If the IMU is set to raw mode, the values in of the ,  and  topics are the 16 bits output of the AD converters. The covariance information in the  message are filled with default values from the MTx/MTi/MTi-G documentation but may not be exact; it also does not correspond to the covariance of the internal XKF. It might be necessary to add the user to the  group so that the node can communicate with the device. mtdevice::MTDeviceimu/datafixvelocityimu/magtemperaturepressureanalog_in1analog_in2eceftime_referenceimu_data_str/imu/data/velocity/magnetic~devicestring""auto""~baudrateint""auto""0~timeoutfloat~frame_idstring~frame_localstring~frame_idmtdevice.pyMTDevicedialoutUsage:

W130,https://wiki.ros.org/xacro,Wiki,xacro,"Xacro (XML Macros)

    Xacro is an XML macro language. With xacro, you can construct shorter and more readable XML files by using macros that expand to larger XML expressions.


: Properties are local if defined inside of a . See . 
: 
: The more powerful evaluation capabilities in ROS Jade allow for much more complex expression. Virtually any python expression that evaluates to a Boolean is feasible: 
: Since ROS Indigo, it is also possible to define defaults like so: 
Comments in front of macros will be removed during processing. They are considered to be related to the macro (e.g. explaining the macro). If you want to keep a comment in the final document, separate it with an empty line from the macro. 
 Macro parameters can have default values: Often, you need to pass external variables into local macro params (as above for x). To ease this task, you can employ the ^ syntax: 
Properties and macros defined within a macro are local to this macro, i.e. not visible outside. Using the optional attribute , a property definition can be exported to the parent scope of a macro (or the global scope). 

 Properties can be dictionaries or lists too - manually declared with python syntax, like so: 
: While this cmake code provides full control over the target name and build order, there is a conveniency macro too: 
: In order to add elements or attributes with a dynamically defined name, you can use the special xacro tags  and : 
: 
:  This package is most useful when working with large XML documents such as robot descriptions.  It is heavily used in packages such as the .  See for example,  for how xacro is used to simplify urdf files. See , for an example showing the use of the advanced features (python evaluation, yaml integration) introduced in Jade. Many of the features highlighted as ""New in Jade"" below are also accessible from Indigo. To use them, the  flag is required. This flag is discussed , and for some background information see this . Put simply, this flag is used to trigger Jade-enabled xacro processing on Indigo. Properties are named values that can be inserted anywhere into the XML document.  Property blocks are named snippets of XML that can be inserted anywhere that XML is allowed.  Both use the property tag to define values. Property tags cannot be declared inside of a . Since ROS Jade, Xacro employs  to evaluate expressions enclosed in dollared-braces, . This allows for more complex arithmetic expressions. Functions and constants from the  math module (e.g.  and trigonometric functions) are available for use. Examples: Xacro allows you to use certain rospack commands with dollared-parentheses (). Xacro currently supports all the rospack commands that roslaunch supports using . Arguments need to be specified on the command line using the  syntax. You can include other xacro files using the  tag: The file ""other_file.xacro"", will be included and expanded by xacro.  : Relative filenames are interpreted relative to the currently processed file. : When including files within a macro, not the macro-defining but the macro-calling file is the one that processes the include! $(cwd) explicitly allows to access files in the current working directory. or loaded from  files like so: If you want the generated files to have a  extension it is possible to provide input files terminating with , the  suffix will be removed by the CMake function. This results in files with a  extension. Usage example for : Classicly Xacro first loads all includes, then processes all property and macro definitions and finally instantiates macros and evaluates expressions. Thus, . Additionally, the conditional tags, <if> and <unless>, have no effect on macro or property definitions nor the inclusion of additional files. Since ROS Jade, Xacro provides the command-line option , that allows to process the whole document in read order. Hence the latest definition of a property or macro , will be used. This is a much more intuitive evaluation process that allows for some nice new features as well: If there are any differences shown, you should check and adapt your xacro file. A common reason will be the late loading of calibration data (as properties). In this case, simply move them up front, i.e. before usage. To facilitate search for wrongly placed property definitions, you can run xacro with option . If there are any problematic properties, they will be listed on stderr: Using the command-line option  or  one can increase verbosity level to log all defintions of properties. To suppress the legacy interpretation of sloppy xacro tags and allow their usage in the target XML, you can use the command line option . --inorderxacro:macroxacro:macropython${}pythonpi$()myvar:=truescope=""parentÂ |Â global""xacro:includeprops.yamlpropsval1.urdf.urdf.xacro.xacro.urdf<xacro:element><xacro:attribute><xacro:attribute>--inorder--check-order-vv-vvv--xacro-ns<xacro:macro name=""pr2_arm"" params=""suffix parent reflect"">

Laser Rangefinder sensors (such as Hokuyo's ) generally output a stream of scans, where each scan is a set of range readings of detected objects (in polar coordinates) in the plane of the sensor. Many robotic systems, like PR2's tilting laser platform, articulate a laser rangefinder in order to get a 3D view of the world. The  package provides nodes that listen to streams of scans and then assemble them into a larger 3D Cartesian coordinate (XYZ) point cloud. The ROS API of this package is considered stable. We don't foresee making any large changes to  anytime soon. The  subscribes to  messages on the  topic.  These scans are processed by the Projector and Transformer, which project the scan into Cartesian space and then transform it into the . This results in a  that can be added to the rolling buffer. Clouds in the rolling buffer are then assembled on service calls. Note that the Transformer automatically receives  data without any user intervention. The  looks very similar to the , except that the projection step is skipped, since the input clouds are already in Cartesian coordinates. The main interaction with the assemblers is via ROS services. The  and  both provide the  service, which is documented below. NOTE: For laser_pipeline releases < 0.5.0, this service is called .

If you want  to show states of robot's actual joint interfaces'  through  and , you need to convert the two interfaces of  to your robot's specific ones via  or RobotHWSim (generally used for ). This is because the controller only update it's basic interfaces mentioned in the previous section. The controller main input is a  topic in the namespace of the controller. An example for usage of  with  can be grabbed from . We developped a general RobotHWSim plugin for usage of . You can get the plugin from  and also see an example of application on .

Users who merely want to open or close the gripper with maximum joint effort do  need to use this package. If you are not worried about damaging the object being grasped, and are not interested in the signals generated during this interaction, you should refer to the simpler  package. The  package contains a set of action nodes. The  nodes provide implementations of  (see ).  The various actions subscribe and publish to a series of messages found in , but this API is not intended for use outside of the pr2_gripper_sensor_* packages. The public API for the various action servers is described in the following subsections, as well as a high-level description of what the node does. This package relies on several parameters being loaded onto the ROS . Currently this is done when the node is  by invoking the  file from the  package. If you wish to permanently edit any of the below values you should see this file. Many users may wish to modify some of these values temporarily and repeatedly during program run time. This can be done by loading a new value for the parameter below onto the param server, and then invoking the  to push these changes into the real-time controller. All the parameters listed below are currently loaded within the namespace of the real-time controller for each of the two PR2 grippers,  and . A  below indicates that the parameter is not reloadable with the . Users should refer to the  section for specific examples on using the action nodes defined below. Currently three  are provided to the user. These services communicate directly with the  package. Most users will generally not need to use them, however, advanced users may find them to come in handy. All services communicate using the standard Empty Request and Response message types.

  The  by Nerian Vision Technologies is a stand-alone processing system for performing stereo matching in real time. It is connected to two industrial USB cameras that provide input image data.   correlates the images of both cameras and produces a disparity map, which is transmitted through gigabit ethernet. The disparity map describes a mapping of image points from the left camera image to corresponding image points in the right camera image. With this information it is possible to reconstruct the 3D location of the corresponding scene points. The data delivered by  can be received using the available open source API. Using the API directly is recommended for high performance applications. Alternatively the  ROS node can be used for publishing the received data as ROS messages. A Nodelet version is also provided. The behaviour of the node can be configured through various parameters. An example parameterization can be found in the included launch file . The following parameters are supported: The topics published by the nerian_stereo node can be viewed with . The disparity map can also be visualized with the  node. In this case color coding should be activated such that the disparity map can be displayed on a screen.

W216,https://wiki.ros.org/joint_trajectory_controller,Wiki,joint_trajectory_controller,"Controller for executing joint-space trajectories on a group of joints.





 Even when a goal has been aborted, the controller will still attempt to execute the trajectory as best as possible. 













 The controller is templated to work with multiple hardware interface types.  Currently joints with ,  and  interfaces are supported. For position-controlled joints, desired positions are simply forwarded to the joints; while for velocity (effort) joints, the position+velocity trajectory following error is mapped to velocity (effort) commands through a PID loop. Example controller configurations can be found . There are two mechanisms for sending trajectories to the controller: by means of the  or the . Both use the  message to specify trajectories, and require specifying values for  the controller joints (as opposed to only a subset) if allow_partial_joints_goal is not set to True. The primary way to send trajectories is through the , and should be favored when execution monitoring is desired. Action goals allow to specify not only the trajectory to execute, but also (optionally) path and goal tolerances. When no tolerances are specified, the defaults given in the parameter server are used (see  below). If tolerances are violated during trajectory execution, the action goal is aborted and the client is notified. The  is a fire-and-forget alternative. Use this interface if you don't care about execution monitoring. The controller's path and goal tolerance specification is  used in this case, as there is no mechanism to notify the sender about tolerance violations. Note that although some degree of monitoring is available through the  service and  topic (see  below), it is much more cumbersome to realize than with the action interface. Only one action goal can be active at any moment, or none if the topic interface is used. Path and goal tolerances are checked  for the trajectory segments of the active goal. Sending an  message from the  (not the action interface) will stop the execution of all queued trajectories and enter position hold mode. The  parameter controls the duration of the stop motion. Joint trajectory messages allow to specify the time at which a new trajectory should start executing by means of the header timestamp, where zero time (the default) means . The arrival of a new trajectory command does  mean that the controller will completely discard the currently running trajectory and substitute it with the new one. Rather, the controller will take the useful parts of both and combine them appropriately. Please refer to the  page for a detailed description of this behavior. The controller exposes a  interface in the  namespace of the controller.

Dump files can be grabbed by , Velodyne's DSR software, , , , or the  command. The  command dumps raw data from the Velodyne LIDAR in PCAP format.

The primary content of the  package is a number of general purpose filters for processing  messages.  These filters are exported as plugins designed to work with with the .  At the moment all of these filters run directly on , but filters may be added in the future which process  instead.  Please review the  for an overview of how filters and filter chains are intended to work. This package provides two nodes that can run multiple filters internally. Using these nodes to run your filters is considered best practice, since it allows multiple nodes to consume the output while only performing the filtering computation once.  The nodes are minimal wrappers around filter chains of the given type.  The  applies a series of filters to a .  The  first applies a series of filters to a , transforms it into a , and then applies a series of filters to the . Each  is a separate plugin exported by the laser_filters package.  This allows them to be specified in a configuration file which can be loaded into an arbitrary filter_chain templated on a . You can instantiate a laser filter into a filter_chain in C++ (), or you can use the  and  nodes which contain appropriate filter chains internally (). The individual filters configurations contain a  which is used for debugging purposes, a  which is used to locate the plugin, and a  which is a dictionary of additional variables.  Consult the documentation for the particular filter plugin to see what variables may be set in the params field. For example, in a package, , to launch a  with two filters:  and , you could use the file: You could then push this configuration to the parameter server using  by running: And then launching the : The scan_to_scan_filter_chain is a very minimal node which wraps an instance of a .  This node can be used to run any filter in this package on an incoming laser scan.  If the  parameter is set, it will wait for the transform between the laser and the target_frame to be available before running the filter chain. The scan_to_cloud_filter_chain is a very minimal node which wraps an instances of  and .  This node can be used to run any filter in this package on an incoming laser scan.  After performing the laser filtering, it will use the  from  to transform each scan into a point cloud.  It will then run any cloud-based filtering, and finally publish the resultant cloud. This filter internally makes use of the the  implementation of float-array filters.  It extracts the range and intensity values and treats each as an independent float array passed through an internal filter chain. This filter removes laser readings that are most likely caused by the veiling effect when the edge of an object is being scanned.  For any two points  and , we do this by computing the perpendicular angle.  That is, assuming the origin of the laser is , the angle formed .  If the perpendicular angle is less than a particular min or greater than a particular max, we remove all neighbors further away than that point. This filter removes all measurements from the  which have an intensity greater than  or less than .  These points are ""removed"" by setting the corresponding range value to  + 1, which is assumed to be an error case. This filter removes all measurements from the  which are greater than  or less than .  These points are ""removed"" by setting the corresponding range value to , which is assumed to be an error case or /. If  is true, the range within the laserscan message is used. This filter removes points in a  outside of certain angular bounds by changing the minimum and maximum angle. This filter removes points in a  inside of certain angular bounds. These points are ""removed"" by setting the corresponding range value to  + 1, which is assumed to be an error case. This filter removes points in a  inside of a cartesian box. These points are ""removed"" by setting the corresponding range value to NaN which is assumed to be an error case. laser_filters.yamlnametypeparamstypepkg_name/FilterClassFilterClassmypkgLaserFilterClass1LaserFilterClass2my_laser_config.yamlscan_to_scan_filter_chainfilters::FilterChain<sensor_msgs::LaserScan>~tf_message_filter_target_frame~scan_filter_chain~tf_message_filter_target_frametf::MessageFilterscanscan_filteredmy_laser_filter.launchmy_laser_config.yamlfilters::FilterChain<sensor_msgs::LaserScan>filters::FilterChain<sensor_msgs::PointCloud>LaserProjection~scan_filter_chain~cloud_filter_chain~target_frame~high_fidelityscancloud_filteredmy_laser_cloud_filter.launchmy_laser_config.yamlmy_cloud_config.yamlrange_filter_chainFilterChainMultiChannelMedianFilterFloatintensity_filter_chainFilterChainMultiChannelMedianFilterFloatmin_angledoublemax_angledoublewindowintneighborsintupper_thresholdlower_thresholdrange_maxlower_thresholddoubleupper_thresholddoubledisp_histogramintupper_thresholdlower_thresholdNaNlower_replacement_valueupper_replacement_valueuse_message_range_limitslower_thresholddoubleupper_thresholddoubleuse_message_range_limitsboolrange_minrange_maxfalselower_replacement_valuedoublelower_thresholdNaNupper_replacement_valuedoubleupper_thresholdNaNlower_angledoubleupper_angledoublerange_maxlower_angledoubleupper_angledoublebox_framestringmin_xdoublemax_xdoublemin_ydoublemax_ydoublemin_zdoublemax_zdoublescan_filter_chain:

For C/C++, only Doxygen is advised. The documentation that is generated will depend on which tool is used, as each tool behaves differently.  For example, Doxygen will extract API details from all source files found in the package (see  for more). You can use  to generate local copies of documentation. When you run the  command, it will generate documentation into the 'doc' folder of the local directory. In order to enable the rosdoc configuration file, simply have a  file in the root of your package. If you wish to name it something else, you must place the following tag in the  section of the , but this behavior is old: Here is an example from the  package, which performs both C++ and Python API documentation: The ""doxygen"" builder will enable running  on a package. As Doxygen is the default builder for any package, it is only necessary to configure this option if: The ""epydoc"" builder will enable running  on a package.

The ""external"" builder specifies that you wish to link to externally generated documentation.  will generate a landing page with the link to the specified URL. To generate a tag file during a documentation run, simply pass the  option to rosdoc lite with a path to the desired location of the tagfile. For example: Running  with this file to get cross references might look something like this: Even if  is automatically generated for your package, we recommend regularly running  on your own computer to verify what your documentation looks like before checking it in. It is also used to generate the data for the ,  and  wiki macros that you see on many of the ros.org wiki pages.

 is most useful for cases where you want to determine which filters to apply at runtime rather than compile-time. 
  
    All message filters follow the same pattern for connecting inputs and outputs.  Inputs are connected either through the filter's constructor or through the  method.  Outputs are connected through the  method. For example, given two filters  and  where 's output is compatible with 's input, connecting foo to bar could be (in C++): The signature of  is dependent on the definition of . You can register multiple callbacks with the  method.  They will get called in the order they are registered. See also:   The  filter is simply a wrapper around a ROS subscription that provides a source for other filters.  The  filter cannot connect to another filter's output, instead it uses a ROS topic as its input. See also: ,  The  filter synchronizes incoming channels by the timestamps contained in their headers, and outputs them in the form of a single callback that takes the same number of channels.  The C++ implementation can synchronize up to 9 channels. (Note: In this particular case you could use the  class from , which essentially wraps the filtering code above.) See also:  The  filter guarantees that messages will be called in temporal order according to their header's timestamp.  The  is constructed with a specific delay which specifies how long to queue up messages before passing them through.  A callback for a message is never invoked until the messages' time stamp is out of date by at least delay. However, for all messages which are out of date by at least the delay, their callback are invoked and guaranteed to be in temporal order. If a message arrives from a time prior to a message which has already had its callback invoked, it is thrown away. See also:   Given a stream of messages, the most recent N messages are cached in a ring buffer, from which time intervals of the cache can then be retrieved by the client. The timestamp of a message is determined from its  field. In this example, the  stores the last 100 messages received on , and  is called on the addition of every new message. The user can then make calls like  to extract part of the cache. The  filter synchronizes incoming channels by the timestamps contained in their headers, and outputs them in the form of a single callback that takes the same number of channels.  The C++ implementation can synchronize up to 9 channels. The  filter is templated on a policy that determines how to synchronize the channels.  There are currently two policies:  and . The  policy requires messages to have exactly the same timestamp in order to match.  Your callback is only called if a message has been received on all specified channels with the same exact timestamp. The timestamp is read from the  field of all messages (which is required for this policy). The  policy uses  to match messages based on their timestamp. See also:  The  filter allows you to dynamically chain together multiple single-input/single-output (simple) filters.  As filters are added to it they are automatically connected together in the order they were added.  It also allows you to retrieve added filters by index. It is possible to pass bare pointers in.  These will  be automatically deleted when Chain is destructed. message_filtersconnectInput()registerCallback()FooFilterBarFilterFooFilterBarFiltermyCallbackBarFilterregisterCallbacks()registerCallback()disconnect()SubscriberSubscribervoidÂ callback(constÂ boost::shared_ptr<MÂ const>&)callback(msg)TimeSynchronizervoidÂ callback(constÂ boost::shared_ptr<MÂ const>&)callback(msg)M0M8voidÂ callback(constÂ boost::shared_ptr<M0Â const>&,Â ...,Â constÂ boost::shared_ptr<M8Â const>&)callback(msg0..Â msgN)TimeSequencerTimeSequencerTimeSequencervoidÂ callback(constÂ boost::shared_ptr<MÂ const>&)voidÂ callback(constÂ boost::shared_ptr<MÂ const>&)headerheadervoidÂ callback(constÂ boost::shared_ptr<MÂ const>&)callback(msg)voidÂ callback(constÂ boost::shared_ptr<MÂ const>&)callback(msg)Cachemy_topicmyCallbackcache.getInterval(start,Â end)headerCacheallow_headerless=TrueSynchronizerSynchronizerExactTimeApproximateTimemessage_filters/synchronizer.hvoidÂ callback(constÂ boost::shared_ptr<MÂ const>&)callback(msg)M0M8voidÂ callback(constÂ boost::shared_ptr<M0Â const>&,Â ...,Â constÂ boost::shared_ptr<M8Â const>&)callback(msg0..Â msgN)message_filters::sync_policies::ExactTimeheadermessage_filters/sync_policies/exact_time.hmessage_filters::sync_policies::ApproximateTimeheadermessage_filters/sync_policies/approximate_time.hheaderApproximateTimeSynchronizerallow_headerless=Trueheader.stampChainChainvoidÂ callback(constÂ boost::shared_ptr<MÂ const>&)voidÂ callback(constÂ boost::shared_ptr<MÂ const>&)

            amcl is a probabilistic localization system for a robot moving in
            2D. It implements the adaptive (or KLD-sampling) Monte Carlo
            localization approach (as described by Dieter Fox), which uses a
            particle filter to track the pose of a robot against a known map.

 transforms incoming laser scans to the odometry frame ().  So there must exist a path through the  tree from the frame in which the laser scans are published to the odometry frame.    To localize using laser data on the  topic: There are three categories of ROS  that can be used to configure the  node: overall filter, laser model, and odometery model. If  is  then we use the  from Probabilistic Robotics, p136; this model uses the noise parameters  through , as defined in the book. If  is  then we use a custom model for an omni-directional base, which uses  through . The meaning of the first four parameters is similar to that for the  model. The fifth parameter capture the tendency of the robot to translate (without rotating) perpendicular to the observed direction of travel. A  was found and fixed. But fixing the old models would have changed or broken the localisation of already tuned robot systems, so the new fixed odometry models were added as new types  and . The default settings of the  parameters only fit the old models, for the new model these values probably need to be a lot smaller, see . Also, another  was found but only fixed after Navigation 1.16, while the current release for Kinetic is Navigation 1.14.1. This bug only affects robot with type  and , where  and  are actually reversed. I.e.  is for the translation odometry noise from robot translation-al motion, and  represents the odometry rotation noise from robot's rotation motion. An implementation detail: on receipt of the first laser scan,  looks up the transform between the laser's frame and the base frame (~base_frame_id), and latches it forever.  So  cannot handle a laser that moves with respect to the base. The drawing below shows the difference between localization using odometry and . During operation  estimates the transformation of the base frame (~base_frame_id) in respect to the global frame () but it only publishes the transform between the global frame and the odometry frame (). Essentially, this transform accounts for the drift that occurs using Dead Reckoning.

In this representation (), the robot is described by the position, velocity and acceleration of it's endeffectors and the Cartesian force they exert. In this representation () the endeffector state is only indirectly given through the joint values. Instead of forces acting on the endeffectors, this state equivalently represents this as torques acting on the joints. The core difference between the above representations is how the articulated limbs and the force they exert are described (task or joint space). In order to make these states most interchangeable, we create a class () that parameterizes each endeffector. This can be done in two ways: convert.h

 The behavior of the ROS wrapper is fully defined by the two configuration files  (which defines the tags and tag bundles to look for) and  (which configures the core AprilTag 2 algorithm itself). Then, the following topics are output: The  teach you how to operate the wrapper. The main idea is to fill out  with the standalone tags and tag bundles which you would like to detect (bundles potentially require a calibration process) and  with the wrapper and AprilTag 2 core parameters. Then, you simply run the continuous or single image detector. The tutorials walk you through how to do this. While this ROS wrapper is original code originating from the author's master thesis, the core AprilTag 2 algorithm in  is wholly the work of the  at The University of Michigan.

  allows developers to switch controllers at run time, but it is not so convenient when you want to switch from a group of controllers to another for some special purposes. The  script makes this easy if such groups are defined in ROS parameter . It knows all controllers involved, and then controllers that need to be stopped and started when it switches from one group to another. Therefore, different groups can share some controllers. 



The  provides a -compatible loop to control a robot mechanism, which is represented by a  instance (see the  package).  The  provides the infrastructure to load, unload, start and stop controllers. When loading a controller, the  will use the controller name as the root for all controller specific parameters, most importantly,  which identifies which plugin to load. You can interact with the  from the command line, using the  script. To interact with a specific controller, use: To automatically load and start a set of controllers at once, and automatically stop and unload those same controllers at once, use the  tool: To automatically stop a set of controllers, and restart them later, you can use the  tool: The listed controllers will be , but not unloaded. Once spawner is shut down, the controllers will be restarted. An example of  parameter: To run the  script:: You could run  to start controllers from within a launch file. However, the controller would then stay up even after the launch file is taken down. Instead, use the tool to automatically load, start, stop and unload a controller from within a launch file. When you start , it will load and start the controller. When you stop  (when the launch file is taken down) it will stop and unload the controller. Your launch file would look something like this: The  is a rqt plugin that allows to graphically load, unload, start and stop controllers, as well as to display information about loaded controllers. controller_managerhardware_interface::RobotHWcontroller_managercontroller_managertypecontroller_managercontroller_managerloadunloadstartstopspawnkilllistlist-typesreload-librariesreload-librariesÂ --restorespawnerunspawnercontroller_managercontroller_groupcontroller_groupscontroller_groupscontroller_grouplistcontroller_groupsspawnÂ <group><group>switchÂ <group><group>controller_managerspawnerÂ spawnerspawnercontroller_manager/load_controllercontroller_manager/unload_controllercontroller_manager/switch_controllerBEST_EFFORTSTRICTSTRICTBEST_EFFORTcontroller_manager/list_controllerscontroller_manager/list_controller_typescontroller_manager/reload_controller_libraries $ rosrun controller_manager controller_manager <command> <name1> <name2> ... $ rosrun controller_manager controller_manager <command>  $ rosrun controller_manager spawner [--stopped] <name1> <name2> ...  $ rosrun controller_manager unspawner <name1> <name2> ...    controller_groups:

 Move Base Flex (MBF) is a backwards-compatible replacement for move_base. MBF can use existing plugins for move_base, and provides an enhanced version of the same ROS interface. It exposes action servers for planning, controlling and recovering, providing detailed information of the current state and the plugin's feedback. An external executive logic can use MBF and its actions to perform smart and flexible navigation strategies. For example,  has successfully deployed MBF at customer facilities to control TORU robots in highly dynamical environments. Furthermore, MBF enables the use of other map representations, e.g. meshes. The core features are: We have created Move Base Flex for a larger target group besides the standard developers and users of move_base and 2D navigation based on costmaps, as well as addressed move_base's limitations. Since robot navigation can be separated into planning and controlling in many cases, even for outdoor scenarios without the benefits of flat terrain, we designed MBF based on abstract planner-, controller- and recovery behavior-execution classes. To accomplish this goal, we created abstract base classes for the nav core ,  and  plugin interfaces, extending the API to provide a richer and more expressive interface without breaking the current move_base plugin API. The new abstract interfaces allow plugins to return valuable information in each execution cycle, e.g. why a valid plan or a velocity command could not be computed. This information is then passed to the external executive logic through MBF planning, navigation or recovering actionsâ feedback and result. The planner, controller and recovery behavior execution is implemented in the abstract execution classes without binding the software implementation to 2D costmaps. In our framework,  is just a particular implementation of a navigation system: its execution classes implement the abstract ones, bind the system to the costmaps. Thereby, the system can easily be used for other approaches, e.g. navigation on meshes or 3D occupancy grid maps. However, we provide a  class without a binding to costmaps. Move Base Flex provides four actions which can be used by external executives to perform various navigation tasks and embed these into high-level applications. In the following the four actions get_path, exe_path, recovery and move_base are described in detail. The action definition files are stores here in the  package.

The Summit XL simulation stack follows the gazebo_ros controller manager scheme described in  Control the robot joints in all kinematic configurations, publishes odom topic and, if configured, also tf odom to base_link. Usually takes as input joystick commands and generates as outputs references for the gazebo controllers defined in summit_xl_control. This package permits an alternative way to control the robot motion (4 motorwheels) that by default is carried on by the Gazebo plugin (skid-steer). In the default configuration this package only controls the pan-tilt camera joints. When used as main controller of the simulated robot, this node also computes the odometry of the robot using the joint movements and a IMU and publish this odometry to /odom. The node has a flag in the yaml files that forces the publication or not of the odom->base_footprint frames, needed by the localization and mapping algorithms.  "

This Package contains a library which is used to convert point clouds and images between ROS and  specific data structures. The structure of this library is mostly based on the -package, for more information you can check out the documentation for that. To be able to build this package and use it in your project you will need to have a version of the  image processing library installed. So far it was tested mainly with version 11 but in theory it should work with higher versions as well as the basic structure of the data types has not changed (build tests have been conducted with version 12 as well). The environment variables  and  need to be set correctly, otherwise cmake won't be able to find your HALCON installation. Usually this should be the case if you have followed the installation guide of HALCON.

W564,https://wiki.ros.org/stdr_parser,Wiki,stdr_parser,"Provides a library to STDR Simulator, to parse yaml and xml description files.
 is a Yaml/XML parser created for . Its job is to parse resource files (robots and sensors) and create the according stdr_msgs. Also, provided a stdr_msgs message  can save it to a Yaml or XML file. The parser structure is such that it can be ""easily"" extended with more file types (such as JSON f.e.) by changing only specific source files (the filetype parser and writer). A brief overview of the parsing steps follow. 

 takes as input a Yaml or XML file and initially does a ""blind"" parsing of the file, meaning that no validation is performed. Of course if the file does not exist or is malformed, a  is thrown. This initial parsing creates a tree consisting of stdr_parser::Node objects and represents the initial file. As the following sections describe, for convenience reasons you can have  tags in your robot or sensor file, which are used for including  other resources (for example in a robot you can include laser and sonar sensors without writing them from the scratch). During the parsing the specific filenames are parsed also recursively. 























































When a  tag is found, during the parsing step, a stdr_parser::Node is created tagged as . For example a robot XML resource follows: and the  In addition, every  contains a level value that is increased when the recurrent file depth increases. After the first step, the tree will look like that (the levels in [ ]): The second step is to eliminate the  tags from the tree. To do so a sanity check is performed: the parent node and the child node of a  node must be the same. If the above holds, the  node is eliminated, as well as its child and the child's children are connected to 's parent. The result follows: The third step is the recursive node merging. In this step the  file under  is of crucial importance. There, the tags that can have multiple occurrences under a specific tag are placed. The current implementation allows multiple occurrences in these tags: This is the final parsing step where the validation is performed. Crucial role plays the  file under . There for every valid tag, the allowed and required children are specified. (Look at the end of the page for the file's contents). The validation step reads this file and performs  and  checks for all tree nodes.  After the tree is fully created,  can create the according . This is performed seamlessly by using templates. An example of creating a  follows: In a similar way a  message can be saved to a Yaml or XML file: If anything goes wrong an  is thrown. The way to use it in a source code file follows: The  exceptions hold a trail of the error for better debugging.

 is a plugin for V-Rep developed by the Inria  team located at . , developed by , is an open-source state-of-the-art (and freely available for academic use) 3D physical simulation engine which is becoming more and more widespread in the robotics community thanks to its flexibility (possibility to simulate many different robotic platforms), dynamical engine (it supports ODE, Bullet and Vortex), and finally customizability (it offers many different possibilities to include one's own code or to interface it with the external world). 
 




 ROS V-Rep Bridge uses the  package. Pluginlib is a C++ library for loading and unloading plugins from within a ROS package. Plugins are dynamically loadable classes that are loaded from a runtime library (i.e. shared object, dynamically linked library). In this way our handlers are actually plugins with some dependencies. If we don't need a handler or we don't have installed its dependencies we are still able to build our bridge (that plugin will not be available). For example, the  needs . If we don't want to install Telekyb we can just add a file called CATKIN_IGNORE in the quadrotor_tk_handler folder and it will not be considered. In spite of this the other handlers will be available. We have an object in the scene (let's say a quadrotor) and we want that the plugin  manage it. To do it we will have to tag the object with a predefined string. If we don't do it the plugin will not act on the object. We will show how to tag a quadrotor but the procedure for the other objects will be similar. The function 'simExtSetFloatCustomDataFromHeader()' adds a custom data to the object related to 'sim_ext_ros_bridge_set_obj_twist_data_main'. As we can see, the function requires a third input. If requested, we can add a value to our custom data, setting the third input of the function. In our case, since we don't want to use this additional parameter we set it to zero (it will be ignored). We can add float and int values. If you want to add an int value you have to use the function 'simExtSetIntCustomDataFromHeader()'. You can find the list of the Custom Lua Variables in the description of each handler. Moreover you will find the complete list in the file  (From line 149). In certain case the third values will be important (for instance to set the frequency of the camera acquisition). You will find more information about these commands in each wiki.ros page dedicated to the packages. You will find a guide for the installation in the .

 is a  for wrapping standard ROS serialized messages and multiplexing multiple topics and services over a character device such as a serial port or network socket. 











Client libraries allow users to easily get ROS nodes up and running on various systems. These clients are ports of the general ANSI C++  library.  Currently, these packages include: Refer to  for details on how to add a new hardware platform. Devices running  code require a node on the host machine to bridge the connection from the serial protocol to the more general ROS network: The number of Publishers and Subscribers are limited at 25, and the size of serialization and deserialization buffers are limited at 512 bytes by default for . However, those numbers and sizes are too big for microcontroller with limited . The buffer sizes, and numbers of Publisher/Subscriber for  now vary depending on the chip used: You can change these numbers and sizes, refer to tutorial  for more informaiton. To conserve precious AVR memory, strings are not stored inside a message instance, instead an  is stored. This has two impacts: Therefore, to send an array message, we have to set the length and pointer. When deserializing, we cannot deserialize in-place like the string (since the bytes of the message are actually packed, unlike a string which is passed in plain form). Therefore, the deserialization function will automatically allocate enough storage using , attempting to reuse the memory location whenever possible and only expanding it when the new message received is larger than the largest previous message. The  protocol is aimed at point-to-point ROS communications over a serial transmission line. We use the same serialization/de-serialization as standard ROS messages, simply adding a packet header and tail which allows multiple topics to share a common serial link. This page describes the low-level details of the packet header and tail, and several special topics used for synchronization. The Protocol version byte was  on ROS Groovy,  on ROS Hydro, Indigo, and Jade. Topics ID 0-100 are reserved for system functions, as defined in the  message.

 The  package is an incremental laser scan registration tool.  The package allows to scan match between consecutive  messages, and publish the estimated position of the laser as a  or a  transform. The  can operate using  messages or  messages. When using , make sure they have no  values.  While the  can operate by just using scan data, we can speed up the scan registration process by providing a guess for the current position of the sensor every time a new scan message arrives. When no guess is available, a reasonable (and widely-used) assumption is that the sensor didn't move (zero-velocity model). Below is a list of inputs that  accepts: We can use combinations of the above such as IMU together with wheel odometry or IMU together with alpha beta tracking. When several prediction modes are enabled, the priority is IMU > Odometry > Constant Velocity > Zero Velocity. Setting the tolerance for updating the keyframe can be achieved via the  and  parameters. Their default values give a more robust performance, both while standing still and moving.

 finds robot maps dynamically and new robots can be added to system at any time.  





This package provides global map for multiple robots. It can merge maps from arbitrary number of robots. It expects maps from individual robots as ROS topics. If your run multiple robots under the same ROS master then  will probably work for you out-of-the-box. It is also very easy to setup an simulation experiment. To make this dynamic behaviour possible there are some constrains placed on robots. First all robots must publish map under , where topic name () is configurable, but must be same for all robots. For each robot  will be of cause different. Two merging modes are currently supported as orthogonal options. If you know initial positions of robots you may preferably use the first mode and get exact results (rigid transformation will be computed according to initial positions). If you don't know robot's starting points you are still able to use the second mode where transformation between grids will be determined using heuristic algorithm. You can choose between these two modes using the  parameter. This is preferred mode whenever you are able to determine exact starting point for each robot. You need to provide initial position for each robot. You need to provide set of  parameters. These positions should be in . See . Estimating transforms between grids is cpu-intesive so you might want to tune  parameter to run re-estimation less often if it causes any troubles.

 The  package contains nodes for object recognition and demonstration grasp selection using models from a grasp database, handled by .  The package also contains a node used for generating object models from grasp demonstrations collected with the  package.  The recognizer has support for a 2D image recognizer to run first in the full recognition pipeline, significantly increasing the runtime of the point cloud recognizer by limiting the number of candidate classes to test with point cloud registration.  This package also contains nodes for data collection, training, and testing of the 2D recognizer. The full recognition pipeline takes in a list of unrecognized segmented objects, such as what the  package provides.  Each unrecognized object will first be classified by the 2D image classifier to determine a set of candidate object classes of high probability.  These candidate classes will then be retrieved from the object model database, handled by , which are then used by the point cloud recognizer to provide a final object label and set of example grasps for picking up the now-recognized object. The 2D image recognizer can be trained in a few steps.  First, an image set representative of the objects in the environment must be collected.  This can be accomplished by running a segmentation node, such as the one found in , and the collect_images node as follows: See the tutorials section of  for details on how to set up an object model database, provide grasp demonstrations, train new object models, and refine existing object models.

The asr_flir_ptu_controller is closely connected to the  as it grants access to the PTU just as the mentioned package. The difference between both packages is that asr_flir_ptu_controller uses  to make the PTU accessible for actionservers by offering an action client that takes new position commands for the pan and tilt values of the pan and executes them with the help of . The package supports the taking of new position goals, constant feedback of the movement and a check if the movement ended successfully. Not fulfillabe goals get filtered out from the beginning - they get rejected. The asr_flir_ptu_controller serves a single purpose: It makes the movement of a Flir pan-tilt-unit accessable by a . The functionality by asr_flir_ptu_controller will be shown below in a sequence diagram. For knowledge of the invoked functions check out . Basic knowledge of the PTU movement (e.g. orientation of axis, movement area, etc.) can be obtained from the documentation of asr_flir_ptu_driver. A lot of functionalities, especially the configuration of forbidden areas, are only available in the asr_flir_ptu_driver and cannot be accessed from here. asr_flir_ptu_controller extends the basic functionalities of movement and forbidden area checking by wrapping them them inside an Action offered by an ActionServer, making invocations easy and offering the opportunity to use the ActionServer in context of a more complex control logic. However, the controller restricts the opportunities of the asr_flir_ptu_driver somehow as it forces the check for forbidden areas and does not allow path_prediction. Being mounted upon the  it is necessary that you have a running instance of asr_flir_ptu_driver, so start it . After starting the asr_flir_ptu_driver, start the asr_flir_ptu_controller. Interaction is then done over the  launched by asr_flir_ptu_controller. As the  has no simulation mode itself, launching it real is the only option you have. Little to no configuration needs to be done before launch if you did not change the topic names used by asr_flir_ptu_driver. Otherwise you need to adjust the corrsponding topic names found in the ptu_controller_settings.yaml file in the param folder. Most of the values there should be fine, nevertheless two should be reconsidered:  and The first one describes the maximum amount of steps that will be done before a movement is considered a failure. A step means hereby a spin of ROS (to be totally fair, it means a publishing from the asr_flir_ptu_driver about his current position, what happens each spin). The second one describes the margin parameter known from asr_flir_ptu_driver. You can set this parameter freely, it is limited by the minimum of the width/height of the pan/tilt movement area divided by 2. From that point on you can use the ActionServer offered by asr_flir_ptu_controller. All topics below are subscribed by the ActionServer of asr_flir_ptu_controller by default. They use a custom defined message which can be found inside the action folder of the package. All published topics by the asr_flir_ptu_controller are related to the ActionServer and should not be invoked from the command line. Use an ActionClient or some tool design for interacting with ActionServers. Most of them are based on a custom ActionServer message that can be found inside the action folder of the package. Nevertheless there exists a very long code example on how to use the Goal/....-callbacks offered by the asr_flir_ptu_controller. Move to the src folder of the package and have a look at the PTUControllerClient.cpp. It is a piece of code that was used to test the behaviour of the ActionServer provided during development and remained here as an example for the usage. Be aware that some of the expected reactions of this program depend on the configuration of the  and the PTU you are using - executing it without adapting it to your data is not recommended. Just use it as an example for usage. If you do not know how to use a ActionServer check out the . "

This assumption typically holds for indoor spaces. We also calculate a transformation between the world frame and a orthogonally-projected base frame of the robot (labeled  in the figure above), and publish it as a  transform.

The  provides a  loop to control the robot mechanism. The robot mechanism is represented by a set of effort controlled joints (see  for details).  For the PR2 robot, we run the control loop at 1000 Hz. The controller manager provides the infrastructure to load your own realtime controller into its control loop. Every controller that is loaded into the controller manager will get triggered once every mili-second. To find out how to write your own hard realtime controller, take a look at . The controller manager ensures that none of the loaded controllers can command a joint past its . If necessary, the controller manager reduces the commanded joint effort, or even applies an effort in the opposite direction. For more details, take a look at the  page. The controller manager publishes the state of all joints over ROS, as  messages. These messages appear on the  topic, at 100 Hz. You can change this publishing frequency by setting the  parameter. To interact with controllers from the command line, use the  tool. To interact with a specific controller, use: To automatically load and start a set of controllers at once, and automatically stop and unload those same controllers at once, use the  tool: To automatically stop a set of controllers, and restart them later, you can use the  tool: The listed controllers will be , but not unloaded. Once spawner is shut down, the controllers will be restarted. You could run  to start controllers from within a launch file. However, the controller would then stay up even after the launch file is taken down. Instead, use the tool to automatically load, start, stop and unload a controller from within a launch file. When you start , it will load and start the controller. When you stop  (when the launch file is taken down) it will stop and unload the controller.

The core functions of this package are the training and recognition of scenes which consist of various objects using Implicit Shape Model (ISM) trees. In addition to the implementation of the tools provided by  there are several visualization (based on ) and utility tools to make the usage of the scene recognition system more convenient. There are two training approaches implemented, one simply being called , the other . They are interchangeable but as they use different algorithms the trained models result in a difference in recognition quality mostly in terms of speed as the latter has a shorter computation time. The input of both trainers is a recording of a scene consisting of multiple objects which is stored in a sqlite database and can be created using the ""Recorder"" tool. The ""Recognizer"" tool uses the trained models and tries to find the most likely match given a set of objects. In general the steps required are the recording of a scene, training a model from this recording and then using the recognizer to get the most likely scene match from a new object configuration.

 Provides an interface to store sets of  objects to a sqlite database. Each set of objects represents a  configuration of objects for a certain scene. The Trainer and the CombinatorialTrainer  are interchangeable, both create a scene model represented by an ISM  from the object poses stored in the recorded database and write it into a  sqlite database. The ISM created by the CombinatorialTrainer should have a shorter computing time when it comes to recognizing a scene compared to the one created by the Trainer. Given a set of objects, the Recognizer calculates the  most likely scenes that those objects are part of. These calculations  use the scene models created by the Trainer/CombinatorialTrainer. 
Delete the recordings or the models or both from the database. Merge multiple databases into one.  Rotate the pose of objects which are determined by a marker e.g. .  Generates additional recording data  between objects by interpolating the pose of two objects between  consecutive recorded object sets.  Transform the absolute pose of an entire scene relative to a world coordinate frame.  Rotate Objects in the  database which are rotation invariant to the y-Axis around this y-Axis  to a given direction. As result these objects get distinct object poses.

W828,https://wiki.ros.org/rail_ceiling,Wiki,rail_ceiling,"Overhead Camera System for Tracking AR Tags












 Rail_ceiling is an overhead camera system for tracking the positions of obstacles in a closed space and publishing maps containing those obstacles for use in robot navigation. Rail_ceiling supports multiple cameras and can publish multiple maps with different obstacle footprints. Obstacle tracking is accomplished using ar tags and the  ros package.  The  node will run an automatic calibration procedure where each camera will take sample poses of an associated marker of known position in the environment.  Once a sufficient number of samples have been taken for each camera, the transforms will be calculated and written to the  file in your home directory, and must then be copied into the  directory of the  package if you wish to use it. The  node provides a method of calibrating the camera transforms from a marker placed on a localized mobile robot, such as the CARL platform.  This calibration method is executed as follows: Next, the robot must be driven into the field of view of a camera to be calibrated.  Once the robot is in the camera's field of view and it is confirmed to be accurately localized, publishing to the  topic with the id number of the camera to be calibrated replacing [camera_id]: Once sufficient samples are collected for all of the cameras, the transforms will be calculated and written to the  file in your home directory, and must then be copied into the  directory of the  package if you wish to use it. The transforms can also be edited directly in the human-readable urdf file, .  This should only be done if the camera positions and orientations can be accurately measured. Furniture footprints and marker information can be configured in the  and  file in the  directory.  The  configuration file defines general pieces of furniture with convex polygon footprints for localization and navigation, and the  configuration file defines instances of furniture with attached markers and their associated poses. To add a new type of furniture, simply add a new entry to the  file.  Each entry must have a name (for identifying the type of furniture) a localization footprint (a set of convex polygons that a laser scanner will detect), and a navigation footprint (a set of convex polygons that represent the full area occupied by the piece of furniture that should be avoided during navigation).  The entry format is as follows: Points composing the polygons are defined with respect to the center of the piece of furniture, according to a coordinate system with x increasing right, y increasing forward, and z increasing up.  In practice, the reference frame's position does not have to be at the center of the furniture piece, as long as it is consistent with the reference frame defined for instances of the furniture type in the  file. Each piece of furniture in th eenvironment must have its own entry in the  file.  Each entry consists of a required type (corresponding with the furniture names defined in ), an optional initial_pose (an initial pose for the piece of furniture in the global coordinate frame), and a required set of markers.  Markers are defined with the unique id used to generate them, and the pose of the marker with respect to the furniture reference frame.  The entry format is as follows: The main functionality of the  package is furniture tracking.

The lyap_control package provides a sophisticated and relatively easy-to-use control node. It can handle regulation or tracking problems of any order and with any number of inputs... from simple first order dynamic systems where a PID controller would typically be used... up to complex, large, higher-order systems. There is also a  which can be used to visualize, tune, and simulate the control algorithm beforehand. The default example of the MATLAB toolbox shows the simultaneous tracking of seven motors. The theory behind the algorithm is explained . (You may have to do this every time you open a new terminal window, or add this line to your bashrc: ) This launches a simulation of a 2nd-order system with (1,-2) setpoints. The displayed  is the sum-of-squares of the error for all states (it should drop exponentially). You may wish to tune the controller at this point. You can adjust its 'aggressiveness', called , in controller.h. Generally a more negative value performs better, unless the time step is too small and it becomes unstable. The saturation limits on the control effort (maximum and minimum) and the controller's model of the system are also adjusted here. The time step for the simulation is adjusted as the variable  in second_order_plant_header.h. A smaller time step will perform better. To demonstrate how to switch to a different dynamic system, a first-order single-input example is included (). Here are the changes that must be made to control this other system: 1. In , change  and  to one-vectors since there is one input now. 2. Edit the model definition in  to update the controller's model of the system. Comment the second equation so there is just one state variable 3. Since there are fewer states and inputs, the messages that the nodes pass must be shorter. In , update  to a 1-vector. In , update  and  to 1-vectors. If you wish to change the initial conditions or the setpoints, or even make a time-varying setpoint, you can do so in .

As a basic example for the types of end-user interfaces that can be created with the Spatial World Model, we look at the Map annotation interface. Information on this interface can be found on the . Below is a video demonstrating its capabilities: The following steps are written for  but apply to most Linux systems. To begin, we must install  and the Python libraries that will talk to it. To do so, run the following command: Finally, we are able to install the database schema. This is provided in a script found in the  package. This script can be used to both install a new database and to update an existing one. In many cases, you will be installing the Spatial World Model database on a central server so that multiple clients (and robots) can talk to it. As of now, the ROS nodes communicate via SQL to the database; however, due to security risks this will eventually be changed. To allow remote connections, we must modify the configuration scripts on the system. Using your choice of editor, modify  with root privileges and add the following line: Next, modify  with root privileges and add the following line: At its core, the Spatial World Model is designed to be a persistent, multi-robot model to keep track of both the robot's working memory as well as keeping track of properties, affordances, and activities that can be associated with each object. To manage persistence, the world model is stored in a  database  At a high level, currently the Spatial World Model allows for two sets of entities: a  and a . A , defined in the  message, can be thought of as a robot's working memory. At a basic level, such an entity contains a relative pose in the world with associated tags and timestamps. These entities describe a particular, specific instance of an object in the world (e.g., the cup sitting on the desk in the conference room). Each instance is linked to a single  which contains a set of spatial descriptors for the object (e.g., mesh, bounding box, point-cloud cluster, etc...). Below is a detailed explanation of the fields in the . Note that some fields will be blank depending on the type of object or what you know about the world.  The second implemented entity is the . This entity, defined in the  message, contains spatial descriptors of objects in the world. These are shared models that are common between all instances of such an object (e.g., a 3D mesh of the object itself). Each descriptions contains a set of tags and an array of actual s. The genericness of the descriptor model allows for models to come from a variety of sources (point cloud segmentation, 3D model warehouses and databases) with few-to-no restrictions. The main idea is to associate an appropriate  and  field with each descriptor to determine how the data should be treated. In a sense, the  field can be thought up as a non-standard MIME type (PNG, Collada, but also  as a type). Future goals of the project set out to create a standard set of accepted type fields. Below is a detailed description of the fields associated with a . The first design decision was to use a  database for storage. Given the highly relational components associated with the world model (e.g.,  and ), it made sense to use such a database over other types of databases. For efficiency in searching and storage, the database schema itself is broken into finer grains than the APIs allow for. It is intended that developers make user of these higher-level APIs when dealing with the Spatial World Model as apposed to making raw SQL queries. The current implementation includes several layers of APIs. As mentioned previously, it is not intended for a developer to use the world model by directly making SQL queries. At the lowest level, the  Python API should be used. This level of the API is responsible for talking SQL to the world model database and is able to make basic insertion and search queries while maintaining the correct structure. This level of the API allows for non-ROS processes to make use of the world model (another future goal of the project). By using an SQL connection between this library and the database, remote connections can be made and a central database can be used (such as one hosted in the cloud). This, of course, requires your server to allow remote SQL connections which is not ideal. Therefore, future plans hope to create a server-side API to allow for remote queries (think REST as an example but this would require polling). With such an API in place, the interface between the robot or client and the database could be made with this new service. Furthermore, a  library is provided in  to allow remote web clients to interact with the world model. This API currently uses  and  to communicate with the world mode; however, as discussed above, the eventual goal is to have a standard server-side API to communicate with directly instead of using ROS. Within ROS, the intended use of the APIs into the world model was to create a series of what are being called listener nodes. Such nodes listen to a set of defined topics, make the appropriate inferences on the information, and update the world model accordingly. Below are three examples included in .  To allow for multiple robots, a notion of namespacing must be kept. To support this feature early on, this information is currently held inside of the  of the instance. It is up to the developer to maintain this namespace. For example, the above listeners take an optional argument to define the namespace. If no namespace is given, it will default to the hostname of the machine the node is running on. In most cases, this is good enough since the hostname of the robot is usually a good namepsace. Then, when searching for things like a particular robot, we can do a tag search for . Future improvements should be made to make this clearer and enforce unique namespacing.  One improvement to the current system would be to separate the  array into its own separate database. The idea behind properties is to define relationships such as  or  between entities in the world model. Current thoughts are to point to entries within a graph database. By doing so, powerful search queries to can written such as ""give me all the objects inside the bedroom?"" or ""is the book on my bookshelf?"" in an efficient way.  One large piece of the world model that is missing is the notice of affordances. The goal of the Spatial World Model is to not only keep track of particular instances of objects, but to also manage what types of actions can be taken on certain objects. For example, a door can be opened, a cup can be grasped, and a robot can grasp (assuming it has a gripper, of course). Furthermore, pre-conditions should also be stored here. For example, the cup must be on the table to be picked up (or any number of other conditions). This would rely on the implementation of the graph database described above. These types of attributes should be stored in a separate table in the database and linked to a particular .  In addition to the affordances, a notion of activities, must be stored as well. Such a structure would be used to figure out how to perform such an action on such an object. For example, if you wanted to use a  action on a coffee cup, the associated activity would be some action call to a grasping pipeline. Each activity can be thought of as a node with some kind of transition model incorporated to provide feedback and belief states. An updated diagram of the Spatial World Model would be the following: In addition to abstracting out the  as defined above, several improvements are needed with respect to the instances. For one, belief states should be associated with most attributes. While the current  does allow for this, beliefs about things just as timestamps are just as important.  A second major component is a cleanser process for the database. Currently, descriptions can be linked to multiple instances. This is the main idea behind the descriptions itself. Additionally, these descriptions can potentially contain massive amounts of data (Collada models for example). If there are no longer any instances linked to a given description, it should be removed not only from the database itself, but from the disk as well (since the large data portions are kept in . Care should be taken to ensure thread safety in the removal. Perhaps the largest piece needed in the project is a more robust, efficient, and flexible server-side API for the world model. Currently, the  Python API is used by the main ROS node and speaks SQL to the database. For many reasons, security being one, this is not ideal. Efforts should be made to create a server-side API that allows for multiple remote connections to interact with the world model. Not only would this still allow the robots to communicate with the world model, but clients could now directly connect to the world model instead of using  as a ""proxy"". While at first glance it may seem appropriate, this API should not be response-based such as a REST API. A more robust socket-level connection should be made to allow for bi-directional communication. By standardizing a server-side interface, we can also create a more powerful query system. The protocol between clients and the server could include things like searching descriptions or descriptors without having to return the data associated with them. This allows clients to subscribe to changes in the world model without the need of polling. A diagram of the updated API levels is shown below. Discussions and contributions are welcome!

    camera used in the forearms and the stereo cameras of the PR2
    robot.








 
 
 
 
 
 





The Willow Garage 100 Mbps Ethernet (WGE100) camera is a 752x480 Ethernet camera developed for the PR2 robot. The PR2's narrow stereo camera is a monochrome WGE100, while its wide stereo camera and forearm cameras are in color. This package contains the , a ROS driver for a monocular WGE100 camera, the  node, which allows two cameras in a stereo pair to be configured from one centralized location, and a suite of  to manage the camera. Except for the  and  tools, which can be used at any time, the WGE100 tools are not designed for concurrent access to the camera. The timestamps returned by the  are with respect to the end of the exposure. The timestamps can be produced in one of two ways: When working with a WGE100 camera, the user needs to identify the camera she wishes to work with.  Cameras are identified using URLs, which can refer either to the camera's serial number or to its descriptive name (set using ). If there is only one camera present, a URL can indicate that whatever camera is found should be used.  If a URL matches more than one camera, none of them will be selected, and an error will be reported. This situation cannot happen with a  URL as camera serial numbers are unique. When an IP address is specified, WGE100 camera tools will configure the camera to use that address before they try to work with it. The IP address that is specified using @ will get reset each time a new tool is used. To set a camera's IP address permanently, use the  tool. In some cases, a single camera may be visible on multiple interfaces, or cameras with the same name may be visible on different network interfaces. In this case, an interface name can be included in the camera URL to force a particular interface to be used for communication. An interface name is introduced with the  sign. For example, on the PR2, only the  interface is searched to avoid potential conflicts with identically named cameras on the wan0 interface:  The  tool uses a broadcast packet to find cameras on the network. It can be run on a single network interface: The IP address that is reported by the  tool is the currently configured address for the camera. This may be different from the IP address stored in the camera's flash, and to which the camera defaults when it is reset. This IP may or may not be valid for the interface on which the camera is located, and it is quite possible that you will not be able to communicate with the camera at this particular IP address. Sometimes a camera can be seen from multiple interfaces. The  tool only reports the first interface on which a response is seen. The camera can nevertheless be configured to run from an interface other than the one on which it was reported. The camera name and IP address that are stored in the camera's flash can be accessed using the  tool. With a single camera URL argument, set_name reports the current settings. The camera intrinsics that are stored in the camera's flash can be accessed using the  tool. With a single camera URL argument, set_name reports the current settings. In general, calibration of the camera and uploading of the parameters should be done through the  package.  These programs will perform the calibration, and make the service call to flash the intrinsics back onto the camera. The camera can be reset using the  command, which takes a single camera_url argument. Note: The  tool currently has the same effect as . In future firmware versions  will always cause the camera FPGA to reconfigure itself, whereas  may do a softer reset that resets all components without reconfiguring the FPGA.

W878,https://wiki.ros.org/leg_detector,Wiki,leg_detector,"Leg Detector using a machine learning approach to find leg-like patterns of laser scanner readings.


This leg detector package takes s as input and uses a machine-learning-trained classifier to detect groups of laser readings as possible legs. Sadly, the training dataset has been lost to Willow Garage history (it wasn't even available before they closed). The code is in the repository for retraining, but is unsupported at this time.  This node will publish s for the individual legs, and it can also attempt to pair the legs together and publish their average as an estimate of where the center of one person is as a . The node will also optionally publish visualization Marker messages to indicate where detections happened.

W887,https://wiki.ros.org/tf,Wiki,tf,"tf is a package that lets the user keep track of multiple coordinate
frames over time. tf maintains the relationship between coordinate
frames in a tree structure buffered in time, and lets the user
transform points, vectors, etc between any two coordinate frames at
any desired point in time.

    : Since ROS Hydro, tf has been ""deprecated"" in favor of . tf2 is an iteration on tf providing generally the same feature set more efficiently. As well as adding a few new features.
    As tf2 is a major change the tf API has been maintained in its current form. Since tf2 has a superset of the tf features with a subset of the dependencies the tf implementation has been removed and replaced with calls to tf2 under the hood. This will mean that all users will be compatible with tf2. It is recommended for new work to use tf2 directly as it has a cleaner interface. However tf will continue to be supported for through at least J Turtle.

A robotic system typically has many 3D  that change over , such as a world frame, base frame, gripper frame, head frame, etc. tf2 keeps track of all these frames over time, and allows you to ask questions like: tf2 can operate in a . This means all the information about the coordinate frames of a robot is available to all ROS components on any computer in the system.  Tf2 can operate with a central server that contains all transform information, or you can have every component in your distributed system build its own transform information database.

:  
A ROS node for starting and controlling a hostapd-based access point. This node works with wifi adapters that have -compatible drivers which support master mode (see  for more information). This is an example that shows how to set up an access point and control its parameters using the  interface. The following launch file starts an AP node on the  interface and the : The desired configuration is selected: mode , channel 44, WPA security with the chosen password, a TX power level of 8 dBm and a TX bitrate of 24Mbit/s. Next the  checkbox is checked at the AP is started: This script is useful for setting up a -based setup. mac80211_hwsim is a 802.11 radio simulator. The script takes two parameters: If the mac80211_hwsim is not loaded or if the number of radios it has currently spawned is smaller than  then it is re-loaded with the proper radio count. The script prints to its output the name of the -th interface. For example (this is taken from a real setup), suppose that the system has a real wireless interface with name  and we need to spawn three virtual interfaces. Their names will be ,  and .

W929,https://wiki.ros.org/costmap_2d,Wiki,costmap_2d,"This package provides an implementation of a 2D costmap that takes in sensor
        data from the world, builds a 2D or 3D occupancy grid of the data (depending
        on whether a voxel based implementation is used), and inflates costs in a
        2D costmap based on the occupancy grid and a user specified inflation radius.
        This package also provides support for map_server based initialization of a
        costmap, rolling window based costmaps, and parameter based subscription to
        and configuration of sensor topics.
  




 

The  package provides a configurable structure that maintains information about where the robot should navigate in the form of an occupancy grid. The costmap uses sensor data and information from the static map to store and update information about obstacles in the world through the  object. The  object provides a purely two dimensional interface to its users, meaning that queries about obstacles can only be made in columns. For example, a table and a shoe in the same position in the XY plane, but with different Z positions would result in the corresponding cell in the  object's costmap having an identical cost value. This is designed to help planning in planar spaces. As of the Hydro release, the underlying methods used to write data to the costmap is fully configurable. Each bit of functionality exists in a layer. For instance, the static map is one layer, and the obstacles are another layer. By default, the obstacle layer maintains information three dimensionally (see ). Maintaining 3D obstacle data allows the layer to deal with marking and clearing more intelligently. The main interface is  which maintains much of the ROS related functionality. It contains a  which is used to keep track of each of the layers. Each layer is instantiated in the  using  and is added to the . The layers themselves may be compiled individually, allowing arbitrary changes to the costmap to be made through the C++ interface. The  class implements the basic data structure for storing and accessing the two dimensional costmap. While each cell in the costmap can have one of 255 different cost values (see the  section), the underlying structure that it uses is capable of representing only three. Specifically, each cell in this structure can be either free, occupied, or unknown. Each status has a special cost value assigned to it upon projection into the costmap. Columns that have a certain number of occupied cells (see  parameter) are assigned a  cost, columns that have a certain number of unknown cells (see  parameter) are assigned a  cost, and other columns are assigned a  cost. The costmap performs map update cycles at the rate specified by the  parameter. Each cycle, sensor data comes in, marking and clearing operations are perfomed in the underlying occupancy structure of the costmap, and this structure is projected into the costmap where the appropriate cost values are assigned as described . After this, each obstacle inflation is performed on each cell with a  cost. This consists of propagating cost values outwards from each occupied cell out to a user-specified inflation radius. The details of this inflation process are outlined . In order to insert data from sensor sources into the costmap, the  object makes extensive use of . Specifically, it assumes that all transforms between the coordinate frames specified by the  parameter, the  parameter, and sensor sources are connected and up-to-date. The  parameter sets the maximum amount of latency allowed between these transforms. If the  tree is not updated at this expected rate, the  stops the robot. There are two main ways to initialize a  object. The first is to seed it with a user-generated static map (see the  package for documentation on building a map). In this case, the costmap is initialized to match the width, height, and obstacle information provided by the static map. This configuration is normally used in conjunction with a localization system, like , that allows the robot to register obstacles in the map frame and update its costmap from sensor data as it drives through its environment. The second way to initialize a  object is to give it a width and height and to set the  parameter to be true.  The  parameter keeps the robot in the center of the costmap as it moves throughout the world, dropping obstacle information from the map as the robot moves too far from a given area. This type of configuration is most often used in an odometric coordinate frame where the robot only cares about obstacles within a local area. costmap_2dcostmap_2d::Costmap2DROScostmap_2d::Costmap2DROScostmap_2d::Costmap2DROScostmap_2d::Costmap2DROScostmap_2d::LayeredCostmapCostmap2DROSLayeredCostmapcostmap_2d::Costmap2Dcostmap_2d::LETHAL_OBSTACLEcostmap_2d::NO_INFORMATIONcostmap_2d::FREE_SPACEcostmap_2d::LETHAL_OBSTACLEcostmap_2d::Costmap2DROScostmap_2d::Costmap2DROScostmap_2d::Costmap2DROScostmap_2d::Costmap2DROScostmap_2d::Costmap2Dcostmap_2d::Costmap2DROS~<name>/obstacles~<name>/inflated_obstacles~<name>/unknown_space~<name>/voxel_grid<point_cloud_topic>""PointCloud""observation_sources<point_cloud2_topic>""PointCloud2""observation_sources<laser_scan_topic>""LaserScan""observation_sources""map""costmap_2d::Costmap2DROS~<name>/global_framestring""/map""~<name>/robot_base_framestring""base_link""~<name>/transform_tolerancedoubleglobal_framerobot_base_frametransform_toleranceros::Time::now()~<name>/update_frequencydouble~<name>/publish_frequencydouble~<name>/max_obstacle_heightdouble~<name>/obstacle_rangedouble~<name>/raytrace_rangedouble~<name>/cost_scaling_factordoubleexp(-1.0Â *Â cost_scaling_factorÂ *Â (distance_from_obstacleÂ -Â inscribed_radius))Â *Â (costmap_2d::INSCRIBED_INFLATED_OBSTACLEÂ -Â 1)~<name>/inflation_radiusdouble~<name>/footprintlist~<name>/robot_radiusdouble~<name>/observation_sourcesstring""""<source_name>source_nameobservation_sources~<name>/<source_name>/topicstringsource_name~<name>/<source_name>/sensor_framestring""""sensor_msgs/LaserScansensor_msgs/PointCloudsensor_msgs/PointCloud2~<name>/<source_name>/observation_persistencedouble~<name>/<source_name>/expected_update_ratedouble~<name>/<source_name>/data_typestring""PointCloud""""PointCloud""""PointCloud2""""LaserScan""~<name>/<source_name>/clearingboolfalse~<name>/<source_name>/markingbooltrue~<name>/<source_name>/max_obstacle_heightdoublemax_obstacle_heightmax_obstacle_height~<name>/<source_name>/min_obstacle_heightdouble~<name>/<source_name>/obstacle_rangedouble~<name>/<source_name>/raytrace_rangedouble~<name>/static_mapbooltruerolling_window~<name>/rolling_windowboolfalsestatic_map~<name>/unknown_cost_valueint~<name>/publish_voxel_mapboolfalse~<name>/lethal_cost_thresholdint~<name>/map_topicstring~<name>/widthint~<name>/heightint~<name>/resolutiondouble~<name>/origin_xdouble~<name>/origin_ydouble~<name>/map_typestring""voxel""""voxel""""costmap""map_type""voxel""~<name>/origin_zdouble~<name>/z_resolutiondouble~<name>/z_voxelsint~<name>/unknown_thresholdint~<name>/mark_thresholdint~<name>/track_unknown_spaceboolfalse(valueÂ ofÂ global_frameÂ parameter)(valueÂ ofÂ robot_base_frameÂ parameter)costmap_2d::Costmap2DROScostmap_2d::Costmap2DPublisherraw_obstaclesinflated_obstaclesunknown_spaceCostmap2DPublishercostmap_2d::Costmap2Dcostmap_2d::Costmap2Dcostmap_2d::Costmap2DROScosmtap_2d::Costmap2Dcostmap_2d::VoxelCostmap2DCostmap2Dcostmap_2d::VoxelCostmap2Dcostmap_2d::VoxelCostmap2Dcostmap_2d::Costmap2DROScostmap_2d::VoxelCostmap2Dcostmap_2d::ObservationBuffercostmap_2d::ObservationBuffercostmap_2d::Costmap2DROScostmap_2d::ObservationBuffercostmap_2d::Costmap2DROScostmap_2d::Costmap2Dcostmap_2d::Costmap2DROSrosrunroslaunchcostmap_2dcostmapmove_base~<name>/footprint~<name>/costmap~<name>/costmap_updates~<name>/voxel_gridcostmap_2dpluginsstatic_layerobstacle_layerinflation_layerplugins~<name>/pluginssequence~<name>/global_framestring""/map""~<name>/robot_base_framestring""base_link""~<name>/transform_tolerancedoubleglobal_framerobot_base_frametransform_toleranceros::Time::now()~<name>/update_frequencydouble~<name>/publish_frequencydouble~<name>/rolling_windowboolfalsestatic_map~<name>/always_send_full_costmapboolfalse~<name>/widthint~<name>/heightint~<name>/resolutiondouble~<name>/origin_xdouble~<name>/origin_ydouble(valueÂ ofÂ global_frameÂ parameter)(valueÂ ofÂ robot_base_frameÂ parameter)costmap_2d::Costmap2DROSObstacleCostmapPlugin

Given a plan to follow and a costmap, the controller produces velocity commands to send to a mobile base. This package supports both holonomic and non-holonomic robots, any robot footprint that can be represented as a convex polygon or circle, and exposes its configuration as ROS parameters that can be set in a launch file.

The  package provides a controller that drives a mobile base in the plane.  This controller serves to connect the path planner to the robot.  Using a map, the planner creates a kinematic trajectory for the robot to get from a start to a goal location. Along the way, the planner creates, at least locally around the robot, a value function, represented as a grid map.  This value function encodes the costs of traversing through the grid cells.  The controller's job is to use this value function to determine dx,dy,dtheta velocities to send to the robot. The groovy release of ROS includes a new implementation of the  package. The implementation attempts to be more modular, to allow easier creation of custom local planners while reusing a lot of code. The code base of base_local_planner has been extended with several new headers and classes. The interfaces and classes below capture the generic local planning principles allowing many instantiations. It should be possible to create custom local planners using the  as template and just adding own cost functions or trajectory generators. This interface describes a Generator which may generate a finite or infinte number of trajectories, returning a new one on each invocation of .  The  class can generate trajectories described in the overview, using either the trajectory rollout or the DWA principle. This interface contains most importantly , which takes a trajectory and returns a score. A negative score means the trajectory is invalid. For positive value, the semantics are that a trajectory with a lower score is preferrable to one with a higher score with respect to this cost function. The  package ships with some cost functions used on the PR2, described below. This is a simple implementation of a trajectory search, taking a  and a list of . It will invoke  until the generator stops generating trajectories. For each, trajectory, it will loop over the list of cost functions, adding up their positive values or aborting the scoring if one cost function returns a negative value. The  is a Controller that can be used as soon as the robot is close enough to the goal. The Controller will then just perform a full stop and a rotation on the spot towards the goal orientation, regardless of whether the robot position after the full stop leads the robot outside the goal position tolerance. The  object is a  for a  object that exposes its functionality as a . It operates within a ROS namespace (assumed to be  from here on) specified on initialization. It adheres to the  interface found in the  package. Example creation of a  object: There are a large number of ROS  that can be set to customize the behavior of the  wrapper. These parameters are grouped into several categories: robot configuration, goal tolerance, forward simulation, trajectory scoring, oscillation prevention, and global plan. The following parameters are only used if  is set to true: The  provides implementations of the DWA and Trajectory Rollout algorithms described earlier. In order to use the  with ROS, please use the . It is not recommended to use the  on its own. The C++ API is stable.

W955,https://wiki.ros.org/wpi_jaco_wrapper,Wiki,wpi_jaco_wrapper,"ROS Wrapper for the JACO Arm Developed at WPI











The  package contains nodes to interface ROS with the JACO API.  It includes publishing angular and Cartesian commands to the arm, generating and following trajectories from input such as !, rotational representation conversions between ROS and the JACO API, and forward kinematics. The  package uses a configuration file to set most of the parameters for its nodes.  This allows for support of different types of arms, such as the Jaco, Jaco2, or the Mico.  The configuration files are located within the  directory, which includes a  file,  file, and  file that define default parameter values for the Jaco, Jaco2, and Mico arms respectively.  The parameters include: The  provides three different options for trajectory execution, each of which has its own action server and its own set of advantages and disadvantages.  The specifics of each trajectory follower, how they compare to eachother, and situations where each one may be applicable are detailed below. The  action server provides the simplest trajectory execution method.  This method sends each point to the JACO arm using the Kinova API, which will then execute the trajectory using its PID controller to move the arm from point to point.  This is the most accurate and precise trajectory follower for point-to-point motion, but for complex trajectories with many points, the point-to-point motion causes the arm to stop at each point resulting in a jerky, uneven overally motion.  As such, this trajectory follower is recommended only for simple trajectories that are comprised of a small number of points spaced far apart, such as pre-defined trajectories for basic motions. The  action server works similarly to the point-to-point trajectory follower provided by , with the addition of the Kinova API's trajectory smoothing.  This is accomplished through first converting the trajectory points from joint position points to Cartesian end effector points.  The Kinova API then smooths the trajectory of the end effector.  This has the disadvantage of requiring the full trajectory to avoid the singularity protection zones defined internally, so this trajectory follower should only be used for trajectories generated from planners that are aware of these protection zones, or for pre-defined trajectories. The  action server provides an alternative to the previous two methods (which rely on trajectory execution through the Kinova API) by using its own trajectory controller and trajectory follower based on velocity control.  The trajectory points are used to generate a linear interpolated trajectory with smoothed corners using the  package.  The trajectory is then followed using a velocity controller, defined in the  file, that sends its control inputs as joint velocity commands through the Kinova API.  This controller is the recommended trajectory follower for execution of complex trajectories with many points, such as those generated by !'s motion planners, as it uses joint control and is therefore not subject to the singularity constraints of the smoothed point-to-point trajectory follower. This package is designed to work with the 2- or 3-fingered gripper included with the JACO, JACO2, and MICO.  With it's default behavior, the wrapper node will publish joint states for the fingers, and includes gripper control action servers.  If you are using an alternative end-effector for your arm, setting the kinova_gripper argument in the  file will disable the finger joint state publishing and the gripper action servers.  This package has been updated to work with the new JACO2.  There is one important difference to note when using this package with the JACO2 instead of the JACO or the MICO.  For the JACO and MICO, the joint state names are published as .  The JACO2 publishes joint state names under a different set of names for compatibility with a new arm urdf.  The joint names, in order from the base to the end-effector, are: [, , , , , ] See the metapackage, , for any other limitations of using this package with the JACO2. To install the  package, you can install from source with the following commands: The  package contains the launch file  which will launch all of the nodes required to send trajectories and manipulation commands to the JACO arm.  Note that the launch file will remap some of the topic names for the trajectory execution actions (this is done for easier ! integration), but these can be changed if desired by editing the launch file.  This can be launched with the following command: wpi_jaco_wrapperjaco_arm/arm_controller/trajectory/goaljaco_arm/smooth_arm_controller/trajectory/goaljaco_arm/joint_velocity_controller/trajectory/goaljaco_arm/fingers_controller/gripper/goaljaco_arm/fingers_controller_radian/gripper/goaljaco_arm/home_arm/goaljaco_arm/arm_controller/trajectory/resultjaco_arm/smooth_arm_controller/trajectory/resultjaco_arm/joint_velocity_controller/trajectory/resultjaco_arm/fingers_controller/gripper/resultjaco_arm/fingers_controller_radian/gripper/resultjaco_arm/home_arm/resultjaco_arm/angular_cmdjaco_arm/cartesian_cmdjaco_arm/joint_statesjaco_arm/angular_cmdjaco_arm/cartesian_cmdjaco_arm/arm_homedjaco_arm/get_angular_positionjaco_arm/get_cartesian_positionjaco_arm/software_estopjaco_arm/erase_trajectoriesjaco_arm/kinematics/fkjaco_conversions/quaternion_to_eulerjaco_arm/erase_trajectorieswpi_jaco/arm_namestringwpi_jaco/finger_scalefloatwpi_jaco/finger_error_thresholdfloatwpi_jaco/gripper_openfloatwpi_jaco/gripper_closedfloatwpi_jaco/max_curvaturedoublewpi_jaco/max_speed_fingerfloatwpi_jaco/num_fingersinthome_arm_on_initboolkinova_gripperbooljaco_arm/manipulation/gripper/goaljaco_arm/manipulation/lift/goaljaco_arm/manipulation/gripper/resultjaco_arm/manipulation/pickup/resultjaco_arm/joint_statesjaco_arm/angular_cmdjaco_arm/cartesian_cmdjaco_arm/get_cartesian_positionwpi_jaco/arm_namestringwpi_jaco/gripper_openfloatwpi_jaco/gripper_closedfloatwpi_jaco/num_fingersintkinova_gripperbooljaco_conversions/euler_to_quaternionjaco_conversions/quaternion_to_eulerwpi_jaco/arm_namestringjaco_arm/kinematics/fkwpi_jaco/arm_namestringwpi_jaco_wrapperconfigjaco.yamljaco2.yamlmico.yamljaco_arm_trajectory_nodejaco_arm/arm_controllerjaco_arm/smooth_arm_controllerjaco_arm/arm_controllerjaco_arm/joint_velocity_controllerjaco_arm_trajectory_node.cpparm.launch[arm_name]_joint_[joint_number]jaco_shoulder_pan_jointjaco_shoulder_lift_jointjaco_elbow_jointjaco_wrist_1_jointjaco_wrist_2_jointjaco_wrist_3_jointwpi_jacowpi_jaco_wrapperarm.launch

This package provides a ROS interface for the . This ROS interface exposes many of the features of the underlying , and is compatible with , , and . This package has been tested with the , on , operating with  cameras. (side-note: it is technically possible to ; see video caption for outline of instructions) This implementation makes use of certain C++11 features (such as std::thread, std::to_string, etc), although the CMakeLists.txt is configured for GCC >= 4.6 (and hence uses the  flag). The IDS camera API allows users to have fine-grain control over the camera on-board processor's clock rate, which determines the range of values for frame rates, exposures, and other camera settings. This can be adjusted at runtime alongside other parameters, via . It is however not recommended to operate the camera at a fast clock rate for extended periods of time, as the onboard processor may get excessively hot. Thus, ideally one should adjust the clock rate to match a target frame rate and exposure setting. You may choose to use the underlying IDS camera API to perform bayer decoding and publish images as 'rgb8' or 'mono8', or alternatively choose to publish images as 'bayer_rggb8' and rely on the standard ROS  package for decoding. Currently, this ROS interface does not expose fine-grain control over the bayer decoding engine from the underlying IDS camera API. A common mistake is to interpret the 'image_width' and 'image_height' ROS parameters as the width and height of the resulting ROS image. Unfortunately, these names were chosen to be consistent with official camera interfaces provided by IDS, and they refer to the width and height of the camera sensor's Area of Interest (AOI). Therefore, values for 'image_width' and 'image_height' that are smaller than your camera's maximum values will result in  (a.k.a. reduced AOI). 1. Install the IDS Software Suite 4.xx for Linux from  2. create catkin workspace . 4. Run  under .

All calibration files are stored by default under:  We have connected multiple cameras in hardware to an Arduino-compatible device (a ), which allows any camera to act as master and any number of other cameras to act as slaves, and achieve synchronization seamlessly with unified hardware add-on required. Please see  for further documentation and instructions. A video demonstration of UEye camera synchronization can be seen . Historically speaking, ueye_cam was based on an earlier ROS package for interfacing with  cameras. Given that the initial work on ueye_cam was done prior to the release of other similar ROS wrappers like  and , the original intention was to keep this code internal so as to avoid contention. Nevertheless, this code has since been released as result of a number of recent requests, with the sole hope that it may benefit the ROS community.

  Use GitHub to . []
 This package contains nodes and libraries for storing and retrieving ROS-related data in a  database using C++ and Python. It is intended to support data persistence and inspection, including in running systems (i.e. introspection). The main functions are the storage and retrieval of single message (this is the ); the rosbag-like logging of topics to the db (via ) and their playback (mongodb_play); and the storage and recreation of parameters. First set the host and port you want the datacentre to run on. We do this via  so that other nodes know where to find the server. If these are not set the server uses a generated port number and  then sets the above parameters to its chosen values. This runs the  server and also provides some utility functions around this. By default, the mongod database will be stored in . This can be overridden by setting the private parameter ~database_path for the node. If it is the first time that the database is used, be sure to first create the database path (e.g. ). To create "" record""-like logging of topics to the  use . This has been updated to store logged data in a format that can be easily recreated into ROS messages for replay. The  node reads logged messages from the store and replays them on their original topics. This provides a similar function to "" play"". Currently this node always creates its own  in order to play back the messages at the time they were originally recorded. will play back messages previously from the   and  topics which were previously stored in the default database ().  and  respect latched topics. 1. .  These should be ""working defaults"" - so all essential parameters at least have a default value. For example, if a robot application requires some calibration data then default values should be provided. Default parameters can be shared among sites and stored inside a shared ROS package. When the config manager is started, all .yaml files stored in a 'defaults' folder will be examined. Any new default parameters will automatically be inserted into the ""defaults"" collection within the configs database. The defaults folder should be supplied as a private parameter:  either set to a system path or in the form . 2. . These parameters override the same named  global default parameters, allowing site-specific parameter setting. They are stored within the database inside the ""local"" collection. At start up, the config manager places all parameters onto the ros parameter server to allow interoperability with existing software. Parameters can also be queried using the , or by directly connection to and querying the mongo database server. Likewise, local parameter overrides can be set using the  service or by directly editing the ""local"" collection in the configs database. The message store node provides services to allow clients to add, update and remove ROS messages in the mongo store via the  object in both Python and C++. This is best demonstrated by examples. With the mongodb server running, run the message store: If the constructor argument to the message store node  is set to true, replication of the message store parts of the store is done manually to allow different content to appear on different hosts. A list of hosts and ports where replications should be made can be set via the  ros parameter: If  is set (regardless of ), queries are performed on the main first, and if nothing found, the replicants are tried. You can test if this works by adding some things to the message store, deleting them from the master using  (not the message store as the deletes are replicated), then running queries. The  action and the corresponding action server: (which is included in ) allows you to bulk copy or move entries from message store collections to the mongod instances defined under . The client accepts a list of collection names and uses the  field of the message store entries to replicate or move all entries that were inserted before a particular time. If no time is provided then the default is 24 hours ago. There is an example client that does this for a list of collections specified on the command line. This *moves* entries inserted 24 hours ago or earlier. ***NOTE THAT this all makes  operations a bit uncertain, so please do not use this type of replication on collections you plan to use update on.*** rosparamlocalhostmongod/opt/ros/mongodb_storemkdirÂ Â -pÂ /opt/strands/mongodb_storemongodb_storemongodb_play/map/tf/scanroslogmongodb_logmongodb_play~defaults_pathpkg://ros_package_name/inside/package/config_manager/get_paramÂ service/config_manager/set_paramMessageStoreProxyreplicate_on_writemongodb_store_extrasmongodb_store_extrasreplicate_on_writeMoveEntriesdatacentre.launchmongodb_store_extrasmeta[""inserted_at""]updateHOSTNAME=yourhost roslaunch mongodb_store mongodb_store.launch db_path:=/path/to/db db_port:=62345rosparam set mongodb_port 62345

However, they both share functionality in that they both subscribe to where people are and alter the costmaps with a Gaussian distribution around those people. Both classes derive from the general SocialLayer class. They can be used in  with the following types: The proxemic layer adds gaussian costs all around the detected person, with the parameters specified above. If the person is stationary, the gaussian is perfectly round. However, if the person is moving, then the costs will be increased in the direction of their motion. How far in front of the person the costs are increased is proportional to the  parameter.  social_navigation_layers::ProxemicLayersocial_navigation_layers::PassingLayer/peopleenabledboolcutoffdoubleamplitudedoublecovariancedoublefactordoublekeep_timedoublefactor"

: The coordinate frame of the camera is expected to be the  frame, which means  is pointing right,  downwards and  from the camera into the scene. The origin is where the camera's principle axis hits the image plane (as given in ). 








This package contains two nodes that talk to  (which is included in the  package):  and . Both estimate camera motion based on incoming rectified images from calibrated cameras. To estimate the scale of the motion, the mono odometer uses the ground plane and therefore needs information about the camera's z-coordinate and its pitch. The stereo odometer needs no additional parameters and works - if provided with images of good quality - out of the box. The video below shows an online 3D reconstruction of a 3D scene shot by a Micro AUV using dense stereo point clouds coming from  concatenated in  using the stereo odometer of this package. In the repository, you can find a sample launch file, which uses a public bagfile available here: . Please read  for an explanation of odometry frame ids. Visual odometry algorithms generally calculate . To be able to calculate  based on , the transformation from the camera frame to the robot frame has to be known. Therefore this implementation needs to know the tf  â  to be able to publish  â . The name of the camera frame is taken from the incoming images, so be sure your camera driver publishes it correctly. If your camera driver does not set frame ids, you can use the fallback parameter  (see below). To learn how to publish the required tf  â , please refer to the . If the required tf is not available, the odometer assumes it as the identity matrix which means the robot frame and the camera frame are identical. In general, monocular odometry and SLAM systems cannot estimate motion or position on a metric scale. All estimates are relative to some unknown scaling factor. libviso2 overcomes this by assuming a fixed transformation from the ground plane to the camera (parameters  and ). To introduce these values, in each iteration the ground plane has to be estimated. That is why features on the ground as well as features above the ground are mandatory for the mono odometer to work.

The  package contains a C++ implementation of the host-side rosserial connection. It automatically handles setup, publishing, and subscribing for a connected rosserial-enabled device. It uses a python node in the rosserial_python package as an aid for handling subcriptions. These nodes use the /ShapeShifter meta message in order to republish messages from clients without having to know about them at compile time. The only caveat to this approach is that the servers do not have the full textual definition of messages (as it is not stored in clients or part of the rosserial protocol). There is a provided Python shim which the servers may optionally use to acquire this information. Example launch files for serial and socket usage are provided in the package. The  parameter to the server allows it to enforce that the client(s) must publish and subscribe to a certain set of topics. This is important because a serial connection provides no guarantee of delivery, and the rosserial protocol doesn't inherently contain any such checks.

The release includes a SLAM package using 2D LIDAR data only as input. Its localization module uses ICP-based registration. The mapping uses a grid map, which cells contain Truncated Signed Distances (tsd), similar to the well known  approach. This representation performs dynamic mapping, wherefore temporary objects are removed over time. The repository comes with an example launchfile, slam.launch. Its parameters are set to fit the typical  rescue scenario deploying a Hokuyo UTM30LX LIDAR or a sensor with similar parameters. This video shows a demo of the package. It uses public available recorded Lidar data, acquired from the University of Freiburg (). The ohm_tsd_slam package is based on our CPU version of the well known  approach,  and is available at .

 The  is based on the exisiting  system. It extends the basic plugin system by a convenient plugin management tool which enables to gather specific plugins based on their provided functionality from a heterogeneous plugin database. Hereby the basic infrastructure remains identically to the original  system as the  is built on top. Using the  allows analogously to load classes from a runtime library (i.e. shared object, dynamically linked library) without the application having any prior awareness of the library or the header file containing the class definition (for details see the  documentation). The  uses the C++ RTTI mechanism to determine the functionality of each instantiated plugin based on implemented parent classes. This information helps the plugin manager to resolve any kind of plugin request done by the application during runtime and allows to manage a heterogeneous plugin database. For clarification, heterogeneous denotes indeed that you can load plugins of different type in one single manager and therefore have convenient centralized access to all your plugins no matter which interface they actually implement. If you need a plugin implementing a specific interface, then the plugin manager tries best effort to deliver them. Polymorphic plugins are indeed allowed, thus a single plugin may implement the interfaces of multiple interface plugins and still will be retrieved correctly. As an example use case for such kind of plugin system, please take a look at the  stack. The  class provides the low level basic functionality needed by the plugin manager. Therefore each new interface plugin must be derived from this class. See . See . Please take also a look at the . A Plugin Aggregator is a collector for a set of plugins implementing a specified interface and simplifies handling of such sets. It obtains automatically all plugins from the plugin manager and provides the option to update parameters of those plugins. The plain  class is ready for use, but may be extended as demonstrated  to perform accumulative operations using the plugins. The  comes with a  widget providing full access to all running plugin manager instance. The widget allows to  monitor the current state of all plugins and even to add and remove plugins during runtime. In  this widget is located in the  menu.

        costmap, the local planner produces velocity commands to send to a mobile
        base. This package supports any robot who's footprint can be represented as
        a convex polygon or cicrle, and exposes its configuration as ROS parameters
        that can be set in a launch file. The parameters for this planner are also
        dynamically reconfigurable. This package's ROS wrapper adheres to the
        BaseLocalPlanner interface specified in the  package.

 The  package provides a controller that drives a mobile base in the plane.  This controller serves to connect the path planner to the robot.  Using a map, the planner creates a kinematic trajectory for the robot to get from a start to a goal location. Along the way, the planner creates, at least locally around the robot, a value function, represented as a grid map.  This value function encodes the costs of traversing through the grid cells.  The controller's job is to use this value function to determine dx,dy,dtheta velocities to send to the robot. The  object is a  for a  object that exposes its functionality as a . It operates within a ROS namespace (assumed to be  from here on) specified on initialization. It adheres to the  interface found in the  package. Example creation of a  object: There are a large number of ROS  that can be set to customize the behavior of the  wrapper. These parameters are grouped into several categories: robot configuration, goal tolerance, forward simulation, trajectory scoring, oscillation prevention, and global plan. Most of these parameters can also be changed using  to facilitate tuning the local planner in a running system.

For more detailed information on the config file, and log4cxx in general, please see the . If you want to include a custom configuration into a specific launch file, you can do so using the  of roslaunch. Rosconsole uses the ""ros"" logger as its root-level logger. All unnamed logging statements will be output to the ""ros.<package_name>"" logger. The named variations will output to ""ros.<package_name>.<name>"". There are a couple of defines that expose this: rosconsole provides a way to remove logging at compile time, though this should rarely be necessary. This is accomplished through the  define. Statements of a severity level lower than  will be compiled out. The options are: If you want to change the logger levels via a configuration file, please see the  section. To change the logger levels from C++, use . Example: If you change one of the 's verbosity levels after any logging statements using that logger, you  call . If you do not, logging statements that have already been hit once (and therefore initialized) may continue to print when they should not, and vice-versa. For examples of this behavior, please see the  file. rosconsole allows you to specify how you'd like its output to show up in the console output through the  environment variable.  The default is equivalent to: By invoking  in C++ the logging subsystem is shut down and therefore no more logging occurs.

The  node wraps the Stage 2-D multi-robot simulator, via libstage.  Stage simulates a world as defined in a  file.  This file tells stage everything about the world, from obstacles (usually represented via a bitmap to be used as a kind of background), to robots and other objects. The .world file syntax is documented in the  . stageros only exposes models created by a subset of the .world file syntax, specifically ,  and  models.  For examples, see the  directory in the  and  packages. If there is only one position model defined in the world file, all of these topics appear at the top namespace. However, if more than 1 position models exist, these topics are pushed down into their own namespaces, by prefixing the topics with  , e.g.,  etc. If there is only one position model defined in the world file, all of these topics appear at the top namespace. However, if more than 1 position models exist, these topics are pushed down into their own namespaces, by prefixing the topics with  , e.g.,  etc. The  topic gives simulated odometry, which is affected by settings in the .world file, which can change its origin and noise model (the transforms mentioned below use the same data); see the  for details on changing this behavior.  The   topic always provides a perfect, globally referenced pose for the robot in the simulation, independent of .world file settings.  The  data is intended for testing purposes; it should not be used in robot control loops (because it's unrealistic). Stage supports the use of ""controllers,"" which are chunks of code that control simulated robots from inside the simulator, instead of being on the other end of a ROS connection.  There are some situations in which it can be advantageous to use Stage controllers.

This package leverages basic  functionality and provides tools to create a map of detected markers in 2D/3D space. It is designed for scenarioand can be used for various navigation tasks for UAVs, UGVs, etc. In order to achieve successfull mapping, everytime when a new marker is detected, previous marker needs to be visible in the actual image to allow computing new marker's position. (See  for better understanding). Keep this principle in mind when placing markers in your environment and do not overdo their mutual distances.

The  package's primary purpose is to provide a library for communicating with motor controller boards.  However, the package does provide the  command-line tool for configuring these boards.  In practice, this tool is used during robot assembly, and should not be needed after initial bring-up of the robot.   When running motorconf, you must specify the interface used to communicate with the EtherCAT devices.  Without any additional arguments,  will enumerate all of the EtherCAT devices it can find. In order to program an unconfigured device, or re-program a device, you must specify a name, motor type, and board type for this motor.  If the name given (using the  option) matches one of the names in the actuators configuration file (, by default), then the motor type and board type will be selected automatically.  The motor type can be specified explicitly with the  option, and the board type can be specified with the  option.  A list of valid actuator names and motor types can be found with the  option.  In addition to the name, motor, and board types,  needs to know which device in the EtherCAT chain to program.  The device number is specified with the  option.  Finally, the  option tells  to actually program the board.  The following example programs device #2 to be the : actuators.conf is an XML file that specifies the motor parameters and common motor names to be programmed into the motor controller boards.  The file consists of a single <configuration> section.  The <configuration> section contains two subsections: <motors> and <actuators>.

  Before the direction commands become activated you have to select a parameter set from the parameter selection section. 
 The terrain generator does only consider all point cloud data around the current robot pose to reduce computational cost. Therefore you should place a  (hotkey ""p"") in RViz in a feasible region of the input pointcloud (see below) to obtain a world model. 



  


 

Use GitHub to . []
 The  stack provides an integrated full 3D footstep planner. It was originally based on the search-based  (using A* from SBPL) and has been intensively extended/rewritten to enable the generation of feasible footstep placements based on perceived 3D data. It can cope with sloped terrain and uses overhanging steps to improve planning performance. The footstep planning system is designed to be easily deployable and adaptable to any humanoid bipedal robot. It can be either used as a 3D planner out of the box, as a research tool in bipedal search-based planning or for benchmarking walking controllers in difficult terrain. For improvement mission performance in real world scenarios, the footstep planner implements a comprehensive set of coactive footstep planning services. In this way, it enables human-in-the-loop planning to combine human intelligence and capable footstep placement algorithms to generate quickly a safe sequence of footstep placements through challenging terrain (examples see under ). This allows for adaptive code execution even during runtime which is superior to classic parameter-based systems. Although plugins can provide new code for the pipeline, already existing code is kept untouched which simplifies code maintenance and improves code stability. In order to achieve this kind of versatile code management, the  has been developed. See under . The  stack consists of multiple repositories located at GitHub: All generated step plan are published on . You can just place a start pose ( (hotkey ""p"")) and goal pose ( (hotkey ""g"")) to trigger planning. You should be able to follow the planning process and receive a result at the end. The planning system is also capable to provide manual step generation. For this purpose the  widget can be launched by: Using this widget allows to lay down patterns of step placements manually. Each parameter can be set individually in this widget. It also includes an interface for the  which manages step execution on the robot. For a quick demonstration of the 3D planning capabilities the  package can be used here. In order to use that package clone and compile from Create the  subfolder in the  package. Download and extract the example pointcloud files from  into this recently created directory. Afterwards you are able to launch the terrain generator test environment (while the footstep planning system is already running in the background): As already mentioned above, you need to set the fake robot pose by placing a  (hotkey ""p""). If you place it like illustrated in the image below, then you should get a nice world model of the pitch ramp scenario.  Please wait a few seconds until the world model is reasonable dense. Now you can request footstep plans over the pitch ramp by placing a  (hotkey ""g""). After a few seconds you should see results similar to that demonstrated on the picture below:  You can also use your own pointcloud data as the  can accumulate data from any arbitrary source. Just launch the standalone : Now you can just publish your pointcloud data as incremental updates at  in a common frame (e.g. ). If you wish to just generate the terrain model from a single pointcloud, the data must be published on . The  stack is accompanied by the  package which enables seamless integration to the low-level motion layer. In particular, this includes step queue management and step queue spooling. Using this package should simplify integration to other robot platforms while providing high-level functionality such as continuous walking (by continuous updating the step queue).

Please take note of the  which provides seamless low-level hardware integration and step queue management in order to simplify even more the migration process while providing a capable step queue management system that allows even for continuous walking. During the Humanoids@RoboCup Demo 2016 at Leipzig, the footstep planner was used as well. If you would like to try it out in simulation by yourself, then just follow the install instruction of the basic THORMANG software  which provides a fully working robot using Gazebo simulation. When Gazebo has started up, first unpause the simulator. Afterwards, you can bring the robot in  mode by using the . You have to proceed following states with the robot: From this point, you can work with the . After selecting a parameter set you can command simple step patterns and directly execute them afterwards. As long you do not push the limits too hard, the robot will execute the steps safely in simulation. As explained  you can use RViz to generate step plans. After a step plan has been generated you can hit the  button in the  which will then execute the recently generated plan. pclvigir_terrain_classifier/vigir/terrain_classifier/point_cloud_update/world/vigir/terrain_classifier/set_point_cloudwalkstand_prepstandwalk@INPROCEEDINGS{2016:Humanoids-Stumpf,

  the following explanations are extracted from demo_app. 

 The demo application is written for a D3-Multisensor smart cam from VRMagic.  This package contains a ROS bridge for the VRMagic smart cameras. It includes a ROS server node named , and a firmware interface for VRMagic smart cams. The firmware interface is implemented as C++ class () and needs to be included in the user's application. Smart cam images are transmitted to the  via this interface. The camhost server provides a ROS multi-channel publisher for the multi-sensor devices. The node receives from the VRMagic smart cam an image via the  class. Each image must have an ID representing a specific channel. An individual publisher is instanciated for each ID. The node verifies for incoming images whether a publisher is already instanciated. New publishers are created during runtime with the following convention for the topic name: <base_topic> + ID, (e.g. base_topic:""topicname"", ID:1 -> ""topicname1""). Or use a launch file and roslaunch with the parameters described in  To use the ROS bridge you have to be familiar with the VRMagic camera user guide, which you can find on the . To use the ROS bridge in your applications, the folder  in  has to be copied in your application's source folder. You have to add all  files in  to your . In the first step a  - object must be instanciated. For that the header file from the class needs to be included. A connection to the ROS server can be established by calling the  method. This method blocks until a connection to the ROS server can be established. With the method  an image is transmitted to the ROS server. Create and fill an instance of  with information about the image format. Image data is passed via the pointer variable . After filling the -object, it must be transmitted to the ROS bridge with the method , see the following code: The example application is located in the folder .

 The urdf of the node makes use of the  tag which is currently only resolved by the robot joint state publisher. in order to generate TFs for the visualization and to get the angles of the coupled joints the node is used in conjunction with a joint state publisher and a robot state publisher. If you include the node without these nodes the TF tree will not be complete as the joints that use mimic are not working. See the URDF section for details on joints, their naming and relation. 
 
: The SVH uses relative encoders that need a hard stop to reset. Especially the finger spread however also contains springs that will lead to a slightly different pose than commanded in real execution. So please beware when you develop poses without the hardware in the loop. 

         
           



This package provides a way of controlling the . It provides the driver for the low level interface and enables an easy control of the hand via ROS . To use this package you will need a .  It communicates via RS485 protocol. Brainbox USB to Serial converter have proven to work well with the hand and are usually delivered in combination with the hand. this will copy the udev rules to  and restart your udev service. If you have the fzi_icl_core or fzi_icl_comm package in your workspace you'll have to build it with , as those packages are plain cmake packages. See the  for details. which will copy the udev rules into  and restart your udev service. 
When using the launch file  all parameters are read from yaml files residing in the folder . If you want to give custom parameters just edit the file  if you are using the source installation. In case of an installation from deb you should first copy the file under  to a folder with user write acces, make your changes and then use it by adding the argument  when launching the node.  If you want to go back to the original values (and have edited the file, residing in etc) you can simply delete the file and copy the  to the name  and start again. If no  file is present the values of the default file will be used. If both files are missing or the node use used without the launch file hardcoded default values that are safe will be used. In any case  as it sets up many variables, the parameter sets and some additional packages that are needed for correct operation and visualization. You can change the device used by adding the argument  to the launch calls, change it via dynamic reconfigure and then do a reconnect or change it permanently by replacing the argument in the launch file. By using the  argument the launchfile will start a joint state publisher for easy input. If you do not activate this as input you have to provide the target positions by another node or console input. The package folder comes with a file called ""quick_commands"" which gives you some examples how to controll the hand via rostopic. By default the node will await input from another node. To use the svh_controller with your project  like this: The node will automatically show the input sliders if started with the standalone argument. If you additionally provide the  argument as true an rqt gui will be opened when launching the node: The  gui opens always to its default configuration (which is usually the last one). The SVH comes with the plugin  which enables easy reset control of the hand. Additionally you can use dynamic_reconfigure to change some of the values and the RVIZ plugin to visualize the robot model of the SVH. A configuration file for rviz is provided with the package at ""urdf/svh.rviz"". Your configuration should look something like this to access all GUI functionalities: as with the real hardware you can choose to use the simulation (which is not really a simulation but just a visualisation) with convenient sliders or with the command line/ your own packages by using the  argument: As a test to see if the hardware is properly working the very simple test node  is provided. Make sure the hand can move freely and run the test with: In case you do not use the autostart feature of the controller you will have to connect and start the controller manually.  You should do this by using the  plugin provided with the package. When the hardware is ready press the connect button. Afterwards you can either reset all or individual fingers by pressing reset. The fingers will be disabled after start but are automatically enabled once a target position is set.

 records packets receive times and sorts them into latency bins based on their travel time. These latency bins can be periodically retrieved and information such as packet loss, average latency and bandwidth can be therefrom determined. 
 is a node that implements an action server which receives link testing goals. It instantiates and collects statistics from multiple s. Each source (i.e. link test) is independent of all others and can be parametrized differently in terms of bandwidth, latency bin thresholds, update (i.e. stats collection) interval and so on. It sends periodical feedback to the action client.  also implements logic for adaptive bandwidth tests: link tests that strive to saturate a link in terms of bandwidth while maintaining latency and loss within specified thresholds.

The basic link measurements are implemented by the class  (defined in ) and the  node.  sends UDP packets at a specified rate to  which timestamps them and echoes them back either via UDP or via ROS topic message. Multiple stream support is built in so multiple s on the same ROS node can ping packets off the same . For a ROS independent setup,  can be used instead of .

If a robot does not require any specific client-side code, then it may be sufficient to run these standard nodes.   describes this usage in more detail. A ROS-Industrial REP describing the Simple Message protocol is currently being reviewed. See . Rather than make a new copy of the entire ROS client codebase, it is recommended that the integrator use a derived-class approach to only re-implement the minimal functionality required.  Wherever possible, the new code should call the base class reference-implementation functions to avoid code duplication and maintain consistent operations.  It may be helpful to review the library's  to determine which functionality may need replacing.  Simple joint reordering and renaming can be handled through existing capabilities, as described . industrial_robot_client

Use GitHub to . []
 The Simple Message (SimpleMessage) protocol defines the message structure between the ROS driver layer and the robot controller itself.  The protocol meets the following requirements: See  for documentation on officially assigned message identifiers to be used for the  field. The message protocol allows for an arbitrary data payload for message and communications types.  However, the client/server model requires that both understand the data payload associated with the different message and communications types.  The typed message class enforces the data payload structure.  The typed message base class provides methods for creating topic, reply, and request messages.  If used in both the client and server, the developer need not understand the structure of the data payload.  Unfortunately, a typical robot controller cannot use C++ classes, and thus the developer must understand the message protocol and payload data structure in order to parse it on the robot controller side.  The documentation on message specific structures can be found in the source header files.  For convenience the message structure is also shown here for common message types.  For a more detailed example of a typed message structure and how it is used see the following . The point data serves as a waypoint along a trajectory and is meant to mirror the  message. This point differs from the ROS trajectory point in the following ways: The simple message utilizes a abstract connection (SmplMsgConnection) interface to send messages to the industrial robot controller.  The interface makes two assumptions: The Message Manager and Handler (MessageManager and MessageHandler) classes can be used to manage a connection that allows for multiple message types to be handled.  The message manager contains a list of message handlers and executed the appropriate handler when a message is received.  These classes are particularly useful on robot controllers which may have a limited number of connections available to them. A Lua Wireshark dissector plugin for the simple message protocol is available from  at GitHub. See the readme for information on how to install it. MSG_TYPErosbuild_add_executable(my_exe my_exe.cpp)

This section gives an overview of the PR2's camera systems. Some readers may want to skip directly to  for a more practical discussion of how to use the robot's cameras, or to the  for a detailed description of the pr2_camera_synchronizer parameters. This section shows how to use the  to set these parameters, they can be set just as easily using any other  mechanism as demonstrated in . Frame rates and projector modes should be set using  on the pr2_camera_synchronizer_node. For example:The synchronizer will make a best-effort attempt at using the rates and modes you requested, but may have to . In that case, the GUI and parameter will reflect the rates and modes that were actually set. Many WGE100 settings not managed by the synchronizer can be set directly with the cameras by using . A detailed list of which parameters can be set in this way without conflicting with the synchronizer can be found . For the forearm cameras, the camera node ( or ) should be configured directly. For the stereo pairs, the wge100_multi_configurator node ( or ) should be configured; this node controls both cameras of a stereo pair, and will dispatch configuration changes to both underlying camera nodes. For the wide stereo camera:For the narrow stereo camera:For the right forearm camera:For the left forearm camera:Please refer to the  documentation for details on what these parameters mean. The following parameters can be set: , , , , , , , , . Please refer to the  documentation for details on what these parameters mean. Note 1: the  stored in the camera is only valid for the region of interest parameters that were used when it was created. The  will refuse to use  with the wrong width and height, but will not detect changes in the other parameters. Images from the wide stereo camera and forearm cameras are published in the ,  and  namespaces, whether they are textured or not. To facilitate using the narrow stereo camera in  mode, textured images from the narrow stereo camera are always published in the  namespace, and untextured images are always published in the  namespace. Due to unresolved firmware bugs, it may happen that a WGE100 camera will become unresponsive. The unresponsiveness of the camera can be verified by running:The easiest way to reset all the WGE100 cameras while ROS is running on the PR2 is to use the   option to true in the  options. This will raise the camera's trigger signal for a few seconds, telling the camera to reset itself. The reset will take about 5-10 seconds.Alternatively, a single camera can be reset when ROS is not running by using the  utility in . For example:In a running PR2, many cameras may be simultaneously in use by different users. Whether the projector should be on at any given time is a combination of the operating modes requested by the user of each camera. The settings of a user's camera depend on whether the projector is on or off. To avoid spurious changes in the settings of one user's camera when another user's camera is reconfigured, the pr2_camera_synchronizer is organized so that there is a master  setting, and a  setting for each camera.  Users request the  that their camera should be in, and the synchronizer decides on the projector state based on the current . For a given , the pr2_camera_synchronizer ensures that the settings of one camera do not depend on the  of the other cameras. In a typical use of the synchronizer, the  is set once and for all by a high-level decision, and users can adjust  at will. The recommended operating mode is .  can be used if longer exposures are needed or if the projector is deemed too unpleasant.  will most likely not be used in practice. In many cases, the camera frame rate must be some suitable divisor of the . When a user sets the frame rate for a camera, the synchronizer will round that rate to the nearest suitable rate, and report the rounded value back to the user via the  mechanism.  The  is not affected by the camera settings. When it is set, it is simply rounded to the nearest divisor of 1 kHz. Again the rounded value is reported back via the  mechanism. To avoid having texture in images taken by the Prosilica camera, the  option can be turned on. In this case, an exposure signal from the Prosilica camera directly inhibits firing of the projector.

The  package also offers several controllers which add higher-level interfaces to common hardware. These include:  The ControllerGUI is a test/teleop node that allows you to control a mobile base and/or your Dynamixel servos. The ControllerGUI publishes geometry_msgs/Twist commands to the  topic, and commands to individual servos. It will automatically determine the names and limits of your servos from your YAML specification file. Launching the ControllerGUI is as easy as:  Moving the red dot up drives the robot forward, moving left/right turns in place, etc. The slider bars move servos, but must be checked to be enabled. When not enabled, they will be updated with the values of the last joint_states message, so that when enabled they will not  to a position, but just torque-on in place. In the above image, only head_pan and head_tilt are enabled. Working with Dynamixel servos often requires some setup of the servos themselves. This is made easy with the ArbotiX terminal tool.

    segbots in simulation and in the real world. Contents 
The segbot robot is a configurable platform, and can support many different sensor configurations. The segbot_bringup package contains launch files for all common sensor configurations. Each configuration brings up all the low level interfaces of the segbot robot (mobile base + sensor drivers). A secondary goal of this package is to abstract potions of each configuration easily so that configuration can be used within the Gazebo simulator. More formally, a launch file in this package should launch the following: ROS node for the segway base driver, found in the  package. For ease of use, a launch file called  can be found in this package which wraps the driver with required parameters.  Kinect - The launch files for the Kinect driver can be found in the  package, which are called by launch files in segbot_bringup. Hokuyo - Launch file for the Hokuyo from  are launched in this package. Sensor Filters (common with simulation) - Data from each sensor is filtered using a number of filters, more details about which can be found in the  package.  (common with simulation) - publishes all fixed joints of the robot on the  tree.  (common with simulation) - publish all non-fixed joints to default values (wheels and the castor joint). Since the segbot robot does not have any true actuated joints, publishing default values for these joints is sufficient for now. 
Each configuration has an auxiliary files that captures all redundancy between real world and simulation, allowing the auxiliary file to be called from a launch script responsible for launching the robot inside simulation. For a robot configuration called  the real robot launch file is called  and the auxiliary file is called . In addition, each auxiliary file must expose  and  as arguments, which are required to launch multiple robots and choose the complexity of the simulation, respectively. To see how these parameters are used, take a look at one of the existing robot launch files in this package, as well as  in the  package.  
The main launch files that run on the real robot are stored in the  directory as  and include the auxiliary launch configuration directly. These files need to call ROS nodes corresponding to the drivers for the segway base and sensors directly. The auxiliary files are stored in the  directory.

Installation instructions can be found in the README file. What you'll need to do will be something like the following: IMPORTANT: Make sure the standard ROS variables are always set in the emacs process environment.  For example, if you use bash, follow the standard ROS installation instructions about sourcing  in your , and launch emacs from a bash shell. Update your , e.g.: For troubleshooting consult the  file. Put the following in your  (e.g. ): The  buffer contains a timestamped list of noteworthy events in the ros system.

 Nodelets are designed to provide a way to run multiple algorithms on a single machine, in a single process, without incurring copy costs when passing messages intraprocess. roscpp has optimizations to do zero copy pointer passing between publish and subscribe calls within the same node.  To do this nodelets allow dynamic loading of classes into the same node, however they provide simple separate namespaces such that the nodelet acts like a seperate node, despite being in the same process.  This has been extended further in that it is dynamically loadable at runtime using . For command line and launch file examples see this tutorial  These are nodelet aware wrappers around  macros.  They include verbosity levels DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, and FATAL.  These macros will only compile inside nodelet methods.

It uses an extended Kalman filter with a 6D model (3D position and 3D orientation) to combine measurements from wheel odometry, IMU sensor and visual odometry. The basic idea is to offer loosely coupled integration with different sensors, where sensor signals are received as ROS messages.










 



The  node does not require all three sensor sources to be available all the time. Each source gives a pose estimate and a covariance. The sources operate at different rates and with different latencies. A source can appear and disappear over time, and the node will automatically detect and use the available sensors.To add your own sensor inputs, check out  All the sensor sources that send information to the filter node can have their own  reference frame, and each of these  reference frames can drift arbitrary over time. Therefore, the  sent by the different sensors cannot be compared to each other. The node uses the  of each sensor to update the extended Kalman filter. As a robot moves around, the uncertainty on its pose in a world reference continues to grow larger and larger. Over time, the covariance would grow without bounds. Therefore it is not useful to publish the covariance on the pose itself, instead the sensor sources publish how the covariance changes over time, i.e. the covariance on the velocity.  Imagine the robot pose filter was last updated at time t_0. The node will not update the robot pose filter until at least one measurement of  sensor arrived with a timestamp later than t_0. When e.g. a message was received on the  topic with timestamp t_1 > t_0, and on the  topic with timestamp t_2 > t_1 > t_0, the filter will now update to the latest time at which information about all sensors is available, in this case to time t_1. The odom pose at t_1 is directly given, and the imu pose at t_1 is obtained by linear interpolation of the imu pose between t_0 and t_2. The robot pose filter is updated with the relative poses of the odom and imu, between t_0 and t_1. The above figure shows experimental results when the PR2 robot started from a given initial position (green dot), driven around, and returned to the initial position. A perfect odometry x-y plot should show an exact loop closure. The blue line shows the input from the wheel odometry, with the blue dot the estimated end position. The red line shows the output of the , which combined information of wheel odometry and imu, with the red dot the estimated end position.  robot_pose_ekfodomimu_datavorobot_pose_ekfrobot_pose_ekf/odom_combinedodom_combinedbase_footprintodomimu_datarobot_pose_ekf <launch>

 If you have the fzi_icl_core or fzi_icl_can package in your workspace you'll have to build it with , as those packages are plain cmake packages. See the  for details. The simpler -interface accepts series of waypoints which the robot will drive to with internal interpolation. It is not guaranteed (and might almost never happen), that all joints finish moving at the same time. If multiple waypoints are given, a new waypoint is started for all joints at the same time as soon as the last joint reached it's previous destination. Ramping up and down between waypoints is done by the robot internally depending on it's configuration. The ramping setup will be treated later on. The -interface provides a position controller in joint space which will interpolate between waypoints inside the controller (on the host PC). You can set joint velocities and time constraints for each waypoint which the controller will take care of. This launchfile gives a ready-to-use action interface for ros_control. It loads controllers defined in  (This can be changed in the ros_control.launch file). Parameters: If your robot arm does use custom canopen IDs, you can modify those in the  file. When modifying the canopen IDs you will also have to modify the node mapping in  which will perform the mapping between the canopen IDs and the URDF joint names. See the example config file for a syntax explanation. When using the simple profile position mode Ramping up and down is controlled by the hardware. The velocity and acceleration can be configured in the file. Also, targets can be commanded as a relative motion to the current position or as an absolute position relative to the home position (which is the default). Change the  parameter if you like to change this behavior. Canceling a goal at high speeds seems to set the robot into a fault state. This comes from within the used position controller as it commands the robot to hold a position which is too far away to be reached within one control cycle.

This is done by the calibration script . When finished, the PR2 joint calibration script stores the joint reference positions locally in the motor controller board (MCB) of the corresponding joint.

 finds robot maps automatically and new robots can be added to the system at any time. 3D maps are expected as , other map messages are not supported.  








The ROS node can merge maps from the arbitrary number of robots. It expects maps from individual robots as ROS topics and does not impose any particular messaging between robots. If your run multiple robots under the same ROS master then  may work for you out-of-the-box, this makes it easy to setup a simulation experiment. In the multi-robot exploration scenario your robots probably run multiple ROS masters and you need to setup a communication link between robots. Common solution might be . You need to provide maps from your robots on local topics (under the same master). Also if you want to distribute merged map and  transformations back to robots your communication must take care of it. Recommended topics names for robot maps are ,  etc. However the names are configurable. All robots are expected to publish map under , where topic name () is configurable, but must be the same for all robots. For each robot  is of cause different, but it does not need to follow any pattern. Further, you can exclude some topics using  parameter, to avoid merging unrelated point clouds. Estimating transforms between maps is cpu-intesive so you might want to tune  parameter to run the re-estimation less often. Alongside ROS node  provides command-line tools to work with point cloud maps saved in  files. Both tools accept any of the . The tools use PCL command-line parsing module. PCL command-line parsing has some limits (PCL users won't be surprised): it supports only  format,  is not accepted. Unknown options are ignored. Options may be arbitrarily mixed with filenames. There are no short versions for parameters. Tool for merging maps offline. Produces  with merged global map. This tool can merge arbitrary number of maps. After one step of the estimation a visualisation window appears. You can freely navigate the point cloud, save a screenshot or camera parameters (press  to see all shortcuts). After the window is closed, estimation continues with the next phase and the next visualisation window appears. Details about estimation progress are printed to .

  The  by Nerian Vision Technologies is a stand-alone processing system for performing stereo matching in real time. It is connected to two industrial USB cameras that provide input image data.  The SP1 correlates the images of both cameras and produces a disparity map, which is transmitted through gigabit ethernet. The disparity map describes a mapping of image points from the left camera image to corresponding image points in the right camera image. With this information it is possible to reconstruct the 3D location of the corresponding scene points. The data delivered by the SP1 can be received using the available open source API. Using the API directly is recommended for high performance applications. Alternatively the  ROS node can be used for publishing the received data as ROS messages. The behaviour of the node can be configured through various parameters. An example parameterization can be found in the included launch file . The following parameters are supported: The topics published by the nerian_sp1 node can be viewed with . The disparity map can also be visualized with the  node.

  Path follows the grid boundaries.  
  Slightly different calculation for the potential. Note that the original potential calculation from  is a quadratic approximation. Of what, the maintainer of this package has no idea.  
  Note that a lot less of the potential has been calculated (indicated by the colored areas). This is indeed faster than using Dijkstra's, but has the effect of not necessarily producing the same paths.  Another thing to note is that in this implementation of A*, the potentials are computed using 4-connected grid squares, while the path found by tracing the potential gradient from the goal back to the start uses the same grid in an 8-connected fashion.  Thus, the actual path found may not be fully optimal in an 8-connected sense.  (Also, no visited-state set is tracked while computing potentials, as in a more typical A* implementation, because such is unnecessary for 4-connected grids).  To see the differences between the behavior of Dijkstra's and the behavior of A*, consider the following example.

It is designed to provide the same software interfaces as , that is, it implements a   (see ), that takes in goals containing  messages.  It is assumed that we are dealing with imperfect localization data: -> is accurate but may be delayed and is at a slow rate and -> is more frequent, but drifts, particularly after rotating. To counter these issues,  plans in the  frame, and waits a short time after each step, and executes movement in the  frame. If goals in the  frame are received, they are interpreted as relative to the robot's current position.  This behavior is different to that of , which will not accept goals in the  frame.

The  node provides a ROS interface for configuring, running, and interacting with the  on a robot. A high-level view of the move_base node and its interaction with other components is shown above. The blue vary based on the robot platform, the gray are optional but are provided for all systems, and the white nodes are required but also provided for all systems. For more information on configuration of the  node, and the navigation stack as a whole, please see the  tutorial. Running the  node on a robot that is properly configured (please see  for more details) results in a robot that will attempt to achieve a goal pose with its base to within a user-specified tolerance. In the absence of dynamic obstacles, the move_base node will eventually get within this tolerance of its goal or signal failure to the user. The  node may optionally perform recovery behaviors when the robot perceives itself as stuck. By default, the  node will take the following actions to attempt to clear out space: First, obstacles outside of a user-specified region will be cleared from the robot's map. Next, if possible, the robot will perform an in-place rotation to clear out space. If this too fails, the robot will more aggressively clear its map, removing all obstacles outside of the rectangular region in which it can rotate in place. This will be followed by another in-place rotation. If all this fails, the robot will consider its goal infeasible and notify the user that it has aborted. These recovery behaviors can be configured using the  parameter, and disabled using the  parameter. The  node provides an implementation of the  (see ), that takes in goals containing  messages. You can communicate with the  node over ROS directly, but the recommended way to send goals to  if you care about tracking their status is by using the . Please see  for more information.

This package provides nodes that can record any and all data transmitted via ROS topics and stores them in the document-oriented database  replicating the message type as document structure. Afterwards, data can be used and queried independently of a particular robot software framework using the existing MongoDB query features with indexes, data locality (sharding) and . This means you can also freely mix in data acquired from other sources, for example using . This project is joint work of the  at The Robotics Institute of the Carnegie Mellon University and the  at the RWTH Aachen University. For more details please visit the . The logger regularly creates graphs based an a round-robin database (RRD) using . Additionally, the  script can be run to create graphs showing the performance of MongoDB. Example graphs look like the following. The  package provides two functionalities. For one there is a node to store all messags of one specific topic to the database, for another it provides a library for other nodes to interact with the database. This mongodb_log package compares to the former part. The  node of the  package stores incoming messages as serialized blobs, much like rosbag does. This way, queries can only be made based on the time of the message. More powerful queries and usage of the data is only possible of a specific node has been created or modified to record data in more verbose documents. The upper graphs shows CPU and memory usage of rosbag, the generic mongodb_log python logger, and the specific C++ logger mongodb_log_tf, all recording the /tf topic at the same time, with transform messages containing 5 transforms at a rate of 100 Hz. We see that the MongoDB C++ logger and rosbag perform with about the same overhead. However, MongoDB is more efficient when writing, because rosbag writes the message type specification for each recorded message (note that MongoDB was writing two topics, one for the Python and the C++ logger each, while rosbag logged only one). The generic Python logger is much more demanding in terms of both, CPU and memory usage. The problem is the inherent Python overhead for deserializing message, which we had also analyzed when developing roslua (cf. ). Hence, logging many unknown topics can put a considerable burden on your logging machine. The data acquired can be useful for a plethora of tasks. We have used it for fault analysis and performance evaluation, as described on the  and in the . More information will be provided at a later point in time.

W1689,https://wiki.ros.org/actionlib,Wiki,actionlib,"The actionlib stack provides a standardized interface for
    interfacing with preemptable tasks. Examples of this include moving
    the base to a target location, performing a laser scan and returning
    the resulting point cloud, detecting the handle of a door, etc.


 

 To accomplish tasks using actions, we introduce the notion of a goal that can be sent to an ActionServer by an ActionClient. In the case of moving the base, the goal would be a PoseStamped message that contains information about where the robot should move to in the world.  For controlling the tilting laser scanner, the goal would contain the scan parameters (min angle, max angle, speed, etc). 
 Feedback provides server implementers a way to tell an ActionClient about the incremental progress of a goal. For moving the base, this might be the robot's current pose along the path.  For controlling the tilting laser scanner, this might be the time left until the scan completes. 
 A result is sent from the ActionServer to the ActionClient upon completion of the goal. This is different than feedback, since it is sent exactly once.  This is extremely useful when the purpose of the action is to provide some sort of information.  For move base, the result isn't very important, but it might contain the final pose of the robot.  For controlling the tilting laser scanner, the result might contain a point cloud generated from the requested scan. 
 


  


  
 Suppose you have defined  in the  package. The following snippet shows how to send a goal to a DoDishes ActionServer called ""do_dishes"".  For the C++ , the  method will only work if a separate thread is servicing the client's callback queue. This requires passing in  for the  option of the client's constructor, running with a multi-threaded spinner, or using your own thread to service ROS callback queues.

In any large ROS based system, there are cases when someone would like to send a request to a node to perform some task, and also receive a reply to the request. This can currently be achieved via ROS . In some cases, however, if the service takes a long time to execute, the user might want the ability to cancel the request during execution or get periodic feedback about how the request is progressing. The  package provides tools to create servers that execute long-running goals that can be preempted. It also provides a client interface in order to send requests to the server. For a full discussion of how actionlib operates ""under the hood"", please see the  . The  and  communicate via a , which is built on top of ROS messages.  The client and server then provide a simple API for users to request goals (on the client side) or to execute goals (on the server side) via function calls and callbacks. In order for the client and server to communicate, we need to define a few messages on which they communicate.  This is with an . This defines the Goal, Feedback, and Result messages with which clients and servers communicate: The action specification is defined using a  file.  The  file has the goal definition, followed by the result definition, followed by the feedback definition, with each section separated by 3 hyphens (). These files are placed in a package's  directory, and look extremely similar to a service's  file. An action specification for doing the dishes might look like the following: Based on this  file, 6 messages need to be generated in order for the client and server to communicate. This generation can be automatically triggered during the make process: Add the following to your CMakeLists.txt file  . Additionally, the  of the package that includes  files must include the following dependencies: Package that depends on actionlib API to implement an action server or use an action client needs another dependency on .

 Vapor_master is a drop in replacement for  enabling high availability ROS service discovery. Vapor removes the single point of failure fundamental to ROS1 enabling new options for achieving greater scale, up-time and resiliency in ROS 1.x solutions. Vapor implements the  as well as the  utilizing a modern micro services approach. Unlike rosmaster, which does only supports an in-memory datastore, vapor persists data to a mongodb database. This enables instances of vapor to come and go without the need to stop all other ROS nodes left running on other computers. In assembly lines and mobile robots utilizing 3 or more computers, vapor_master can be deployed to all compute nodes. While mongodb can be deployed to a minimum of 3 nodes. In this scenario the ROS_MASTER_URI can be set to  as if each node were its own rosmaster. In this way an given compute node can come and go as needed without preventing ros parameter access or service discovery. http://localhost:11311"

     Interfaces to the ""HighLevel"" Processor of the Ascending Technologies helicopters where fast IMU datafusion with arbitrary external position input and position control is executed at 1 kHz. 
     Furthermore, all relevant data as IMU, GPS and status can be accessed at configurable rates and baudrates.

  













 This package provides a ros interface to communicate with the High Level Processor (HLP) of the AscTec AutoPilot. Therefore, firmware for the HLP is needed which is provided in the  package. It does not work with the firmware shipped with the HLP! Using a wired connection is recommended, e.g. to the Ascending Technologies . The cable supplied with the AtomBoard can be used. Connect to the serial port 0 of the Highlevel Processor (""HL serial 0"") as shown in the AscTec  in chapter 4.1. In this case, set  to the correct port, and leave  and  empty.  If you plan to use a wireless serial link, it might be useful to use a dedicated link for each rx and tx for higher bandwidth. In that case, set  and  accordingly and leave  empty.  The baudrate at which the  communicates with the HLP can be set with the  parameter. If it doesn't match a supported standard baudrate, the closest standard baudrate is chosen. The HLP tries to detect the baudrate automatically at startup or if there wasn't any communication with the hl_node for longer than ~10 seconds.  sets up its serial port(s) with the desired baudrate and sends a packet ('a') which the HLP uses to detect the correct baudrate. In order for this to work, always switch on the HLP first, then start . In case you need to restart  with a different baudrate, you have to wait ~10 s until the HLP accepts new baudrate configure packets. Restarting with the same baudrate works immediately. Tested baudrates are: 57600, 115200, 230400, 460800, 921600.  Packet rates of certain packets can be configured with the  parameters. No polling is done - instead a configuration packet is sent to the HLP which will send the packets in the desired rate accordingly. Note that no checking is done if the packet rates exceed the available bandwidth, so check the correct rate with  In all operation modes, you can enable/disable control output to the LLP by setting the  parameters accordingly. This is helpful, e.g. to debug a controller on a single axis first. Directions and orientations follow the . As with the direct interface to the LLP, it only accepts commands when the serial enable switch is on. In failure, flip off this switch and put the flightmode switch to ""acc"". There are three modes you can operate the helicopter which you can select with the  parameter: Set  to ""off"". This mode just forwards roll, pitch, yaw (angular velocity) and thrust commands to the LLP. This is similar to directly send commands to the LLP's serial interface. Set the values in  in rad for roll and pitch, in rad/s for yaw and 0.0 ... 1.0 for thrust and set /type to ""acceleration"". For the scaling to work correctly, you need to set  and  to the values you can read out from the LLP with the AscTec control software (default 25, 120). Messages have to arrive at least at 10 Hz, otherwise nothing will be forwarded to the LLP.  yaw rates are limited to +- 85% so that the motors cannot be switched on/off accidentally in case of bad commands (motors idle, full yaw). Set  to ""GPS"" and set /type to ""velocity"" in your messages. Commands are also forwarded to the LLP, but the GPS bit is set additionally. The values in  correnspond to velocities in boady coordinates in m/s and rad/s respectively. For the scaling to work correctly, you need to set  according to the maximum ""stick-GPS"" velocites which you can read out from the LLP with the AscTec control software. Defaults are 5 m/s for x/y, and 2 m/s for z.      Messages have to arrive at least at 10 Hz, otherwise nothing will be forwarded to the LLP.  yaw rates are limited to +- 85% so that the motors cannot be switched on/off accidentally in case of bad commands (full descend rate, full yaw) This is the most interesting part and main motivation for this project. It is designed for position control based on position measurements from e.g. onboard visual SLAM with typically slow update rates. To deal with those delays, datafusion with IMU and position control is performed on the HLP at a rate of 1 kHz. Details on how the controller and datafusion work can be found in .

W1737,https://wiki.ros.org/markov_decision_making,Wiki,markov_decision_making,"Markov Decision Making (MDM) is a ROS library for robot decision-making based on MDPs.
                This metapackage contains: the Markov Decision Making Library itself (mdm_library), 
                the auxiliary packages Predicate Manager (predicate_manager) and Topological Tools (topological_tools),
                and an example application of MDM (mdm_example)


 MDM helps you map between the abstract representations of ,  and  that are used in decision-theoretic frameworks, and the actual actuators and sensors of your robots. It also interprets your decision-making policies and lets you configure an appropriate run-time execution strategy. Note that . For that you can use ROS-independent toolboxes such as . But once you have a decision-theoretic policy, MDM helps you execute that policy on your robot. MDM has been used (and is being used) in several international research projects, including ; ; and . In the following sections, you can find a light technical description of MDM, and information on how to use the library for your own MDP-based applications. For a more in-depth look into MDM, you can also refer to . For an overview of the concepts underlying MDM, please see the page . You can find examples of how to implement each MDM layer in the . MDM is modular and meant to be flexible and easy to adapt to your own applications. You can find more information on various specialized use-cases of MDM in the page:  Q: 
 A: There are so many generalizations and variants of the MDP framework that it is virtually impossible to design a library that supports all of them out-of-the-box. Rather than trying to explicitly support all MDP variants, MDM gives you the building blocks that you can use (and adapt) to put together a decision-theoretic controller for your robot(s). The underlying motivation is much of the implementation work that goes into deploying a decision-theoretic control policy can be re-used across different robot applications, regardless of the particular MDP variant that you're using. However, if you adapt MDM to your own application, you're encouraged to contribute to the library with your own modifications, since that may help other users in the future. Feel free to contact us, in that case! Q: 
 A: Without going into a discussion as to why regular discretizations aren't a particularly good idea, note that as long as your state space is discrete and finite, then your states can be indexed by a fixed-length string of logical values (i.e. in binary). In other words, as long as you have enough predicates, you can represent any (finite) discrete state space. The  package is lightweight and designed to handle a very large number of predicates, if needed. If you really want a ""grid world""-like representation of your state space, you can either write a generic  predicate and instantiate it for each your cells, or use the pose_labeler package (included in topological_tools) together with a map of the environment in which each cell is uniquely colored. Q: 
 A: Although the default MDM State and Action Layers implicitly describe discrete state and action spaces, you can potentially use the same node layout, and implement a State Layer that outputs real-valued scalars or vectors; a Control Layer that maps that into a real-valued action, and an Action Layer that just maps those into actuator controls. We don't have any plans at this time to extend MDM by ourselves to continuously-valued domains, but if you're interested in doing so, please feel free to contact us. Q: 
 A: Yes, there is a (currently experimental) branch in the Git repository that already supports some of the most basic RL algorithms for MDPs (Q-learning, SARSA). "

 Make sure you have the minimum required ROS Version for statistics. arni shell output and debug messages will tell you if there is any problem on the current host. On remote hosts you have to check their log as well.   This may be due to many different problems. Make sure the host really sends data and that the values in the GUI are changing. If this is the case it might be that the remote host is sending data too seldomly. Currently we do not interpolate between two data points, which means, if the host sends data every ten seconds and the graph show only 10 seconds the graph will move out of range immediately.  The solution is updating the time range, e.g. to 30 seconds.   Advanced ROS Network Introspection (ARNI) extends the  features introduced with Indigo and completes the collected data with measurements about the hosts and nodes participating in the network. These are gathered from an extra node that has to run on each host machine. All statistics or metadata can be compared against a set of reference values using the . The rated statistics allow to run optional  when a deviation from the reference is detected, in order to remedy the fault or at least bring the system in a safe state. All data can be displayed and monitored through new . a) Publishing  data for topics and connections.  Publishing /statistics_host and /statistics_node data.  Comparing actual values to a YAML specification (d) and publishing /statistics_rated.  Automatically acting on rated data, given a YAML countermeasure file (f). g) ARNI rqt_gui to visualize current state of ROS network. h) rqt_gui Node Graph showing /statistics data.

 ROS comprises a large number of packages.  However, with the exception of some core packages that everything else depends on, e.g.,  and , many of the packages are largely independent.  As such, we have provided a  to allow you to only build what is actually necessary to run the packages that you want to run. A package may depend on any number of other packages, requiring that those packages be built first.  These dependencies are specified in the package's  file.  However, it would be inconvenient to make you go and look at the dependencies for your package, and then in turn look at the dependencies for those packages and so on.  Instead, we provide  to do the ROS-wide build of everything you need for a given package. For example, to build the  package, you can simply run: If rosmake fails, there is a good chance you are missing  for one or more of the packages you are trying to install. NOTE: you can run  from anywhere, as it uses  to locate packages. If you really just want to build a package, and you know that its dependencies are up-to-date, you just type  in that package's top-level directory. You  run  multiple times simultaneously on one machine, unless you are sure that the builds don't share any dependencies.  You may end up building the same package simultaneously, which can cause various problems.

 The  is a CRAM package that extends  system and  environment with functionality of generating a PDF file that contains easy to read (e.g. pie charts, bar charts, tables) robot experiment statistics. Alternative version of this guide is available . This package is based on  and its interpreter - the main log analysis and computations are done therein.   Once the data is prepared part of it is passed to  via  interface where its processed and needed graphs are prepared.  is also used to store statistics and dump them into CSV and RData formats for easy post-processing. Then, links to prepared figures and log statistics are passed via JPL to  where they are prepared and injected into selected LaTeX templates with use of  . Finally, the same library is used to generate a PDF based on prepared tex files. For details please refer to below figure. To make the package the most universal the report card generation is based on two key concepts  and . This approach allows the user to choose the design of the report card and decide which sections should be placed within. Moreover, this design facilitates creating personalised section and including them in the report card without complex code alterations and rebuilding the whole package - see below. This templates specify overall design of the report card - please see  for an example. The most important part of it are  statements which include specified in  sections. The default layout allows up to 10 sections. Section templates specify the structure of each section in the document - please see  for an example. There are 4 different types of variables that can be used in each section: To add your custom section to the report card please create a file named  in the  directory. Use the arguments naming as described above - the order of the arguments is based on the order used in the  call done within .   To generate your section from within  add a new predicate to  file: Where  is path to the temporary directory of current report card;  is the section name (it MUST contain the exact name you gave to your section file without  extension),  and  are as described above and of type  and finally,  and  are as described above and of type . If you have no data of specific type to be passed to the section creator you should generate empty array for the first two types e.g.  and empty array of arrays for latter two types e.g. .   To alter current generator please append your section to  predicate as follows: If you prefer to create custom report card generator first add type predicate to the already existing list:  and then create custom loader for created type: To manually generate the report card (using  shell) please use the following sequence: Before generating a report card remember to load the data e.g. !

 Messages received by retalis from the subscribed topics are automatically converted to events. For example, the following message of type  Events are time-stamped according to header times of ros messages. If a message does not have a header, it is time stamped with .  The format of time-stampes are   where  encodes nanoseconds since seconds (i.e. stamp.nsec in ros messages). For example, the above  message contains a list of  messages (only one here). While each   message is time-stamped, the  itself does not have a header. Therefore, the corresponding event is stamped with the current time. The following rule calls  the  function for every  event received by retalis. Each  message from  contains a list of recognized objects, each represented by a   message. The following rule generates a separate event for each object. where  represents a recognized object and  encodes the time of recognition. This time corresponds to the time of taking the picture at which the object was recognized. This time is taken from the header file of the corresponding  message. The events is also time stamped with . Retalis integrates the '.  supports temporal and logical reasoning on flow of events. Please see   for publications and for examples of rules implementing various event-processing functionalities. This memory instance keeps the history of events of the form , specified by the first argument. The second argument specifies a list of conditions, being empty here. A memory instance only records events that satisfy the conditions. The third argument specifies the format for recording events. The fourth argument is the Id of the memory instance. The last argument is the size. Only the last 2500 events of the given form are maintained by this memory instance. The  event from Section 4.1.3 matches this memory instance. This events is recorded by this memory instance as . We saw in Section 4.1.3 that the  and  functions are implemented as Prolog clauses. The  file can include an arbitrary Prolog program to encode a domain knowledge. We also saw in Section 4.1.4  that how memory instances are used to maintain histories of events The Prolog program in  together with the the dynamic knowledge maintained by memory instances represent a Prolog-based knowledge base. This knowlede base can be queries by event-processing rules, for instance, as in Section 4.1.3. It can be also queried directly by a ros service (in our  list). An example of using  and  terms is in implementation of the  function, in the eventRules.txt. The input values to this function is the  of a memory instance, keeping the history of some  events, and a time point. The  events represent observations of the transformation between two coordinate frames over time. From these observations, this function interpolates the transformation between the frames at time . This is implemented as follows. The last observation before  and the first observation after  are found using the  and  terms. Then the position is linearly interpolated by making a function call to the  library that has been integrated with retalis. The  function in eventRules.txt uses the  function to position an object in the world reference frame. Given , the position of an object relative to the camera at time , this function computes , the position in the world, as follows. First, it changes the time format from ros time to datime. Then, it interpolates the transformation between , , ,  and  at the time . Third, it applies these transformations on the  by making a function call to the  library. It is assumed that the  frame is aligned with the world reference frame. We saw in Section 4.1.6 that how calling  function interpolates the position between the  and  coordination frames at time . This function uses  and  terms to access the first and the last observations after and before , respectively. To interpolate the position at , the position should have been observed, at least once, after . The observations,  messages here, are received asynchronously. Therefore, the  function should be evaluated only after the  memory instance has been updated with an event occurring after . This is realized in retalis using a synchronized event, as follows. The  function, performs the , when the  are satisfied and then generate the . Consider the following clause from eventRules.txt: This rule computes the position of recognized markers in the world and is read as follows.   For each  event, specified in line 6, the position is computed by calling the  function, as in line 3. After computing the position, an event of the following form is generated, specified in line 2: Such a  event encodes the marker's name, its position in the world and the time of recogntion. The  are the followings, specified in line 4: These conditions specify that the  function should be evaluated, only after all , , ,  and  memory instances have been updated, at least once, with events occurring after time . The time  is the time of recognition of the marker. Retalis performs the synchronization of events in an event-driven and efficient way. The generation of a synchronized  is posponed, until the  are satisfied. Postponing an event does not postpone the generation of other events and postponed events are generated as soon as necessary conditions are met. The subscription subscribes the topic  to the  events in which  is . Such events are generated by the synchronized rule, presented in Section 4.1.7. They contain the position of the marker  in the world coordination frame.  The id of the subscription is  which can be used to cancel the subscrition at any time. The following figure shows the CPU time used by the retalis and retalis-ros-converter nodes when running the NAO example. The retalis node calculates the position of objects in real-time. It processes about 1900 events, memorizes 130 new events and prunes 130 outdated events per second.  It also queries memory instances, 70 times per second. These tasks are performed using about 18 percent of the CPU time. In this experience, the retalis node has been directly subscribed to the  and  ros topics. The retalis-ros-converter only subscribes retalis to the  topic and converts and publishes events about objects' positions to ros topics. To have this setup, comments out the subscriptions to  and  topics in the pub-sub.xml file and instead, set the  boolean variable in the retalis_interface.cpp file to . You should also recompile the package. As we saw in Section 4.1.2, retalis provides an easy way to subscribe to ros topics and automatically convert ros messages to events. This is implemented by the retalis-ros-converter node. The implementation is in Python and is realized by inspecting classes and objects at runtime and therefore is expensive. The following figure shows the CPU time used by the retalis and retalis-ros-converter nodes for the NAO example, when the retalis-ros-converter is used to subscribe to  and  topics. This results show that while the automatic conversion among messages and events are desirable in a prototyping phase, the final application should implement it in C++ for performance reasons. We will investigate the possibility to re-implement the retalis-ros-converter node in C++. The following figure shows the CPU time for a number of runs where up to 160 memory instances are added to the NAO example. These memory instances record  events. Among the events processed by retalis, there are no such events. The results show that the increase in CPU time is negligible. This shows that a memory instance consumes CPU time only if the input stream of events contains events whose type matches the type of events the memory instance records.  In the following figure, the green and blue lines show the CPU time for cases where 20 memory instances of type  are added to the NAO example. These memory instances match all  events, about 1900 of such is processed every second. The size of memory instances for the green line is 2500. These memory instances reach their size limit in two seconds. After this time, the CPU time usage is constant over time and includes the costs of unification, assertion and retraction for updating 20 memory instances with 1900 events per second. The size of memory instances for the blue line is 150,000. It takes about 80 seconds for this memory instances to reach their size limit. Consequently, the CPU time before the time 80 only includes the costs of unification and assertion, but not the costs of retraction. After the time 100, the CPU usages of both runs are equal. This shows that the cost of a memory instance does not depend on its size. The purple line shows the CPU time for the case where similarely there are 20 memory instances of type . However, these memory instances record events until their reach their size limit. We added a condition for these memory instances such that after reaching their size limit, they perform no operation when receiving new events. After the time 100, the CPU time is constant about 23 percent, being 5 percent more than the CPU time of the NAO example, represented by the red line. This 5 percent increase represents the unification cost. This also shows that the costs of about 38000 assertions and 38000 retractions per second is about 30 percent of CPU time. In other words, 2500 memory updates (i.e. assertions or retractions) are processed using one percent of CPU time. The following figure shows the CPU time for a number of runs where up to 40 memory instances of type  and size 2500 are added to the NAO example.  The red line at the bottom shows the CPU time for the NAO example. We make the following observations. Adding first 10 memory instances to the NAO example increases the CPU time about 20 percent. After that, adding each set of 10 memory instances increases the CPU time about 13 percents. This shows that the cost grows less than linearly. The implementation of memory instances is in a way that the cost of an assertion or a retraction can be assumed constant. This means that the unification cost for the first set of memory instances is the highest. In other words, the unification cost per memory instance decreases when the number of memory instances are increased.  The following figure shows the CPU time for a number of runs where up to 640 memory instances of type  and size 2500 are added to the NAO example. The events matching these memory instances are received with the frequency of 50 Hz. We make the following observaitons. First, it takes 50 seconds for these memory instances to reach their size limit. After 50 seconds, these memory instances reach their maximum CPU usages, as the costs of retraction is added. Second, each memory instance filters 1900 events per second recording about two percents of them. The cost of 640 memory instances is about 35 percent of CPU time. Third, the unification cost per memory instance is decreased when the number of memory instances are increased. The following figure compares the costs of different types of memory instances. The purple line shows the CPU time for the case where there are 10 memory instances of type . The green line shows the CPU time for the case where there are 320 memory instances of type . We observe that the costs of both cases are equal. The memory instances in the former case record 19,000 events per second (i.e. 10*1900). The memory instances in the latter case filter 1900 events per seconds for  events, recording 16000 events per second (i.e. 320*50). The results show the efficiency of the filtering mechanism. The brown line shows the CPU time for the case where there are 10 memory instances of type  and 320 memory instances of type . Comparing it with the green and purple lines shows that the CPU time usage of these memory instances is less than sum of the CPU usages by 10  memory instances and 320  memory instances. This shows that the  unification cost per memory instance is decreased when the number of memory instances are increased, even when the memory instances are not of the same type. The green line in the following figure shows the CPU time of the NAO example adapted as follows. There is an additional  memory instance of size 128. This memory instance is queried by 1000  terms for each recognition of an object. In average, 7000  terms are evaluated per second. The blue line visualize the CPU time of a similar program in which 7000  terms are evaluated per seconds. The figure shows that the costs of the evaluations of  and  terms are similar. The purple line shows the CPU time of the case where 14,000  terms are evaluated per second. We observe that the cost grows linearly, as expected. The blue line in the following figure visualizes the CPU time of the case where 7000  terms are evaluated per second. The green line visualizes the CPU time of the case where there are 320  memory instances. The purple line visualizes the CPU time of the case where 7000  terms are evaluated per second and there are 320  memory instances. We observe that the cost of accessing a memory instance does not depend on existance of other memory instances. The green line in the following figure visualizes the CPU time of evaluating 7000  terms per second on a memory instance of size 128. The blue linevisualizes the CPU time of evaluating 7000  terms per second on a memory instance of size 16384. The size of the memory instance in the latter case is the power of two of the size of the memory instance in the former case. The increase in the CPU time for the latter case, with respect to the NAO example, is less than two times of the increase in the CPU time for the former case.     The red line in the following figure visualized the CPU time of the NAO example where in each second, 1000  queries on a memory instance of size 2500 are evaluated. In addition, for each  query, a new event is generated. The green line visualizes the CPU time of a similar case where the next queries are synchronized. This experiment is conducted in a way that no query needs to be delayed. Coparing these two cases shows that when queries are not delayed, the synchronization cost is negligible. Information flow processing systems such as Etalis are designed for applications that require a real-time processing of a large volume of data flow. Please see  for the evaluation of the performance of on-flow functionalities. The evaluation results show, in terms of performance, Etalis is competitive with respect to the state-of-the-art on-flow processing systems. add_output_subscriptiondelete_output_subscriptionadd_memorydelete_memoryadd_input_subscriptiondelete_input_subscription__0____0____0____0__'""/odom""','""/base_link""''â/odomâ',Â 'â/base_linkâ'ToDoEventRelativePosAbsolutePoseRelativePosAbsolutePoseCameraTopRelativePosSynchConditionsQuerySynchConditionsEventPoseStampedSyncConditionsPoseStamped'""4x4_1""'__0____0__CameraTop_frame

(Main author) Roberto MartÃ­n-Martin (, ) Sebastian HÃ¶fer (, ) Oliver Brock () 1. . Three estimation levels: feature tracking, feature-based rigid body tracking, kinematic model estimation. This option can execute only using RGB-D images and therefore requires less computational power.  To try this option, download one of the rosbags with the ""_imgs"" suffix and launch OMIP using the option ""--omip=1"" (or ""--omip=2"" if you want that the terminals  remain open after finishing the execution, for debugging purposes). More frequent problem: The feature tracking is not running and looks like frozen -> Check in feature_tracker/cfg/feature_tracker_cfg.yaml the depth_img_topic name. Depending if you are using openni or openni2 (or rosbags generated from one or the other package) the name of the topic for the depth maps is different. Based on the recursive estimation schema - prediction/correction -  our framework can cope with the high amount of data provided by the robot's sensors . The key (and the main idea of our framework) is to factorize the perceptual problem into smaller *perceptual units*, solve them with single recursive estimation loops and connect all the loops tightly.  The connection of the loops defines a bidirectional information flow between loops: a bottom-up flow to pass estimations as measurements to more abstract levels, and a top-down flow to pass predicted measurements as predicted next states to less abstract levels. By connecting the loops our framework can interpret the combined sensor-action stream as evidence of concepts of different level of abstraction. Each recursive estimation level is realized as a ROS node that implements the interface .  A recursive estimation level is defined by: * Measurement * State * Priors: Internally, each level contains at least one recursive estimation filter. These filters implement the interface . The levels call the corresponding correct-predict methods of the filters and pass the measurements/states up and down. rosrunÂ omip_launchÂ omip.shÂ --helpgit clone https://github.com/tu-rbo/omip.git

  Please take a look at the  on how to install, compile, and use this package. Check out the code at:  This package provides a way of running reinforcement learning experiments with the agents from the  package and environments from the  package without using the  interface. Instead, the code instantiates agent and environment objects and calls their methods directly. It can be set to run for a particular number of episodes and trials, and prints out the sum of rewards for each episode to cerr. There are a number of options available to set parameters of both the agent and environment used.  More details on the agent options are available in the  documentation, and more details on the env options are available in the  documentation. In addition to these options, there a few variables that can be changed in the code, in the . Near the top of the file are two variables: MAXSTEPS and NUMTRIALS. MAXSTEPS determines the maximum number of steps for an episode. A new episode will be started after this many steps even if the agent has not reached a terminal state. As an example, here is how you would run Q-Learning () on the stochastic Taxi task (): Or to run real-time TEXPLORE (, ) at 10 Hz on the deterministic Fuel World task () with 8 discrete trees: While you should find that the qlearner, sarsa, dyna, and rmax agents work fine on the easier tasks (tworooms, taxi, etc), they will not converge within the default 1000 episodes on more complex tasks like Fuel World. As an example, here is how to run Q-Learning () on the Fuel World task () using the --nepisodes flag to run it for 1,000,000 episodes, which should be enough time for it to converge. Another problem you may run into is when running these methods on the continuous domains (mcar, cartpole, car2to7, car7to2, and carrrandom). For these domains, the tabular RL methods (Q-Learning, SARSA, Dyna, R-Max) will need the state to be discretized. The following command will run Q-Learning () on the Mountain Car task () while discretizing each of the state features into 10 discrete values using the --nstates option. rosrun rl_experiment experiment --agent type --env type [options]qlearner sarsa modelbased rmax texplore dyna savedpolicytaxi tworooms fourrooms energy fuelworld mcar cartpole car2to7 car7to2 carrandom stocks lightworldrosrun rl_experiment experiment --agent qlearner --env taxi --stochasticrosrun rl_experiment experiment --agent texplore --nmodels 8 --planner parallel-uct --actrate 10 --env fuelworld --deterministicrosrun rl_experiment experiment --agent qlearner --env fuelworld --nepisodes 1000000rosrun rl_experiment experiment --agent qlearner --env mcar --nstates 10"

The  package provides various methods for human control of the JACO and JACO2 arm via keyboard teleoperation and joystick/gamepad teleoperation.  This may work for the MICO as well, but it has not yet been tested. The joystick teleop node currently supports both gamepads with analog triggers and gamepads with digital triggers.  The gamepad type can be set on launch with the  parameter.  Currently, the node has been tested with the Logitech Dual Action wired controller (digital triggers), the Logitech Wireless Gamepad (analog triggers), and the Microsoft XBOX 360 wired controller (analog triggers).  If your gamepad does not work with this node, you can remap the axes and buttons using  package, or open an issue in the code repository and support for the new controller may be added. To install the  package, you can install from source with the following commands: Joystick or keyboard teleop can be started with the launch files  and , respectively.

W2005,https://wiki.ros.org/sound_play,Wiki,sound_play,"sound_play provides a ROS node that translates commands on a ROS topic () into sounds. The node supports built-in sounds, playing OGG/WAV files, and doing speech synthesis via festival. C++ and Python bindings allow this node to be used without understanding the details of the message format, allowing faster development and resilience to message format changes.














 If you need the information in this section for something other than satisfying curiosity, you are probably doing something wrong. The  node considers each sound (built-in, wave file or synthesized text) as an entity that can be playing, playing repeatedly or stopped. Nodes change the state of a sound by publishing to the  topic. Multiple sounds can be played at once. C++ and Python bindings are provided. It should be unnecessary to directly generate messages when playing sounds from C++ or Python. Documentation of the language bindings are in . The following utilities can be used to play sound when  is running. For help on getting  running refer to the . The  script can play any  or  file. The file must be available on the computer on which  is running, and an absolute path should be given. Some standard sounds are built-into the driver, and can be played only by specifying their integer identifier using . For example ( should be running first): To get an up-to-date list of the built-in sounds, consult the definition of the  message. The relevant information is below the """" comment. The sound node can also be used to synthesize speech using the . The  script gives command-line access to this functionality. This script can take its input from the command line, or if the command-line is empty it can take input from standard input. Examples ( should be running first): The most immediate way to silence the robot is to use  to mute or lower the volume. In some cases, a node that had requested a continuous sound could crash with the sound still playing. In order to stop that sound the  script can be used. The  script sends a stop command on all sounds every 100ms until it is terminated. This behavior will immediately stop any continuous sounds that were playing, and will cut short any new sounds that are played. It will not completely silence the robot, however, as the first tens of milliseconds of newly requested sounds will be played before they are silenced. To test that  is operating correctly, you can use the  script. It will play the various built-in sounds, and exercise the  playing and text-to-speech capabilities. To run it: The following launch file, which starts , can be found in : Sound commands are issued to  via a  message. Commands define two things: a sound, and what to do with that sound.  The sound is defined by the  (int) and  (string) fields of the message, and can be one of four types: Each message on the  topic will cause a sound to transition between the playing continuously, playing once (or twice) and stopped states. For example, a backing up sound could be initiated by sending a command for a backing up sound to play continuously. When the robot stops backing up, a stop command will stop playback. Likewise, verbal debugging messages could be used by telling a sound to play once. In this case there is no need to stop playing the sound. robotsoundrobotsoundrobotsoundrobotsoundrobotsoundrobotsoundrobotsoundrobotsoundrobotsoundrobotsoundsound_playrobotsoundsoundplay_node.pysoundplay_node.pyplay.py.WAV.OGGsoundplay_node.pyplaybuiltin.pysoundplay_node.pySoundssay.pysoundplay_node.pyalsamixershutup.pyshutup.pysoundplay_node.pytest.py.WAVsoundplay_node.pyrobotsoundrobotsounddiagnosticssoundplay_node.pysoundplay_node.launchrobotsoundsoundplay_node.pysoundargsoundPLAY_FILEsoundsoundplay_node.pyargSAYsoundargALLsoundrobotsound$ rosrun sound_play play.py --help

It has a confidence (a float), a boolean telling if it is a 'known' transition or not, a float predicting the reward, a float predicting the termination probability, and a map of states (vectors of floats) to floats that gives the probabilities of next states.

The state s the agent came from is a vector of floats, the action it took is an int, the reward it received is a float, and the next state s' it transitioned to is a vector of floats. In addition, there's a bool indicating if the transition was terminal or not. Full documentation for the experience struct is available . Agent is defined with a number of methods. Mainly it has first_action(state) which is called for the first action in an episode and returns an action. After that next_action(reward, state) should be called, which returns an action. Finally upon reaching a terminal state, last_action(reward) can be called. In addition to these methods, seedExp(vector of experiences) can be used to seed the agent with a set of experiences. Full documentation for the Agent class is available . The environment has a sensation() method which returns the current state vector and a terminal() method tells if the agent is in a terminal state or not. The agent can act upon the environment by calling apply(action) which returns a reward. A set of experience seeds to initialize agents is available using the getSeedings() method. There are also a number of methods to get information about the environment such as getNumActions, getMinMaxFeatures, getMinMaxReward, and isEpisodic.

Newly proposed, mistyped, or obsolete package. Could not find package ""remote_manipulation_markers"" in rosdoc: /home/rosbot/docs/api/remote_manipulation_markers/manifest.yaml 




The  package contains interactive marker servers for a set of remote manipulation interaction approaches.  The approaches include Free Positioning, Constrained Positioning, and Point-and-Click.  These interactive marker servers are intended for use with rviz or with Robot Web Tools interfaces. This package includes three approaches:  Free Positioning (FP), Constrained Positioning (CP), and Point-and-Click (P&C).  The three approaches are shown below, with interaction points for setting initial poses shown in yellow, and interaction points for adjusting poses shown in blue. Free positioning uses a ring-and-arrow marker which can be clicked and dragged to individually adjust translation along and rotation about each Cartesian axis.  Constrained positioning uses a sphere marker to first set a grasp point, followed by setting an approach angle by clicking on the surface of the sphere.  The approach angle is constrained to pass through the grasp point.  Point-and-click makes use of autonomous grasp calculation, and involves the user selecting a previously calculated grasp for execution from a list of potential grasps.  Further details on these can be found in , published in HRI 2017.  The approaches are designed for both 2D and 3D visualization modes.  For full details and a comparison of the efficiency and effectiveness of each approach in both 2D and 3D visualization modes, see our IJRR 2019 article . Videos of the approaches in action can be found  and . To install the  package, you can install from source with the following commands: Note that  and  include a boolean parameter .  Setting  to true will launch a  node that corresponds to the free or constrained positioning node.

 A mobile robot that can be used with the  (publishes /odom and /tf. Receives velocity commands ..). The robot must also be equipped with a laser scanner or any sensor that publishes laser scan message (). This package provides an exploration strategy for single or multiple robots. However, for it to work, you should have set your robots ready using the navigation stack. And each robot should run the ""slam_gmapping"" node from the  package. Note: If you want to quickly run and test the package, you can try out the  package which provides Gazebo simulation for single and multiple robots, you can use it directly with this package. The move_base_node node, which brings up the navigation stack on the robot, must be running. This package (rrt_exploration) generates target exploration goals, each robot must be able to receive these points and move towards them. This is why the navigation stack is needed. Additionally, each robot must have a global and local cost maps. All of these are proivded from the . The robot should have a local map generated from the  package. For the multi-robot configuration, the package doesn't require special network configuration, it simply works by having a single ROS master (can be one of the robots). So on the other robots, the  parameter should be pointing at the master's address. For more information on setting up ROS on multiple machines, follow  link. All robot's frames should be prefixed by its name. Naming of robots starts from ""/robot_1"", ""/robot_2"", ""/robot_3"", .. and so on. So for robot_1, the frames in the  tree should look like this: The move_base_node node, which brings up the navigation stack on the robot, must be running. This package (rrt_exploration) generates target exploration goals, each robot must be able to receive these points and move towards them. This is why the navigation stack is needed. Additionally, each robot must have a global and local cost maps. All of these are proivded from the . Each robot should have a local map generated from the  package. There should be a node that merges all the local maps into one global map.

Official source code for rosjava projects can be found on github in the . Rosjava is largely used to build Android applications. For information specific to that use case refer to the  wiki page. 
The documentation on the wiki here provides a general overview of the rosjava ecosystem and install/build instructions. For tutorials and coding level API documentation, refer to the github generated documentation. Links below.  : what to expect and what tools are used for rosjava development.  : list of all official and semi-official packages in the rosjava-android ecosystem.  : the anatomy of a typical rosjava package.  : some environment variables that can influence the build of rosjava stacks.  : messages are handled slightly differently in rosjava.  : detailed coding level documentation and tutorial information.  : frequently asked questions. 

These tutorials revolve mostly around development in a catkin-rosjava workspace environment (aside from the installation).  Installation instructions from debs, sources, or maven. Script wizards for conveniently creating rosjava packages and projects. How to create, compile, and execute a simple publisher and subscriber in rosjava.

W2121,https://wiki.ros.org/move_base_to_manip,Wiki,move_base_to_manip,"Move the robot base until a desired end-effector pose can be reached.
  





For mobile manipulators, this package calculates a robot base location where the end-effector (EE) can reach a desired pose (a.k.a. inverse reachability). The method is computationally fast (since it depends on a  Cartesian motion plan), simple (~300 lines), and easy to use (requiring just a service to provide the desired pose). Below, the first image shows a mobile manipulator which is too far to grasp the object of interest. The desired EE pose is shown in green. The second image shows the freshly-calculated base position (red cube) which will allow the robot to reach that pose. <<Please ignore the bad camera calibration>> This package uses  for base commands and  for manipulator motion planning.  ^This launches a ROS service that will make a desired pose available to the move_base_to_manip node. It also displays this desired pose in Rviz. When the client sends  on the service request, this node will shut down after providing the pose. ^This node requests the desired pose from the other node. It then moves the end-effector to the desired height and orientation. From there, it plans a Cartesian move to the desired pose. The % completion of the Cartesian move informs the base on how far it must move. If the Cartesian move is able to complete 100%, the arm moves and the program exits. Otherwise, there is a call to  to get closer to the object: The planner reads optional parameters on the . They can be adjusted from the command line, programmatically, or left as their default values. They are: * : A fraction between 0 and 1. A value of 1 means the EE will barely be able to reach the desired pose when fully extended. A value of 0 means the base motion will bring the EE to the desired pose without additional arm motion. Default: 0.15.  * : Use a Cartesian motion for the final arm approach, or a regular  motion? The Cartesian motion may be useful if your task requires the gripper to maintain a constant orientation (like grasping often does). Default: false, i.e. do a regular motion. * : Clear the octomap collision scene before the final arm approach? This is often necessary for grasping -- otherwise sensor noise/resolution may lead the robot to expect a collision. Default: true, i.e. the collision scene will be cleared. * : Clear the move_base costmaps before base motion? Default: true. * : Ask the user before making any motion? This is useful if you're just starting to use the package and aren't sure what to expect. Default: true. * : This is the ""request"" part of the service call. Can be used as a signal that the server can shutdown. Default: true (which I use to signal the pose provider node to shut down). * : A smaller number results in a more accurate prediction of the distance to the pose of interest. Default: 0.005m * : Default ""right_ur5"" * : Default ""RRTConnectkConfigDefault"" * : % of maximum robot speed for all arm motions. Default: 0.1 * : Default ""base_link"" * : Position tolerance for arm motions. It may be useful to bump this up if you are having trouble finding plans. Default: 0.01 m * : Orientation tolerance for arm motions. Default: 0.0001 rad * : If true, the planner will try to flip the EE +/-180 deg about Z (i.e. ) when it cannot reach a desired pose. Then it will attempt to plan again. Useful for 2-finger grippers. Default: true Here are some hints to get more suitable trajectories from : * Make sure the resolutions of your costmap and  planners are fine enough to get the accuracy you require. Here are  from the creator of . This package only calculates one base position which can reach the desired pose. If the base is not able to move there, it fails. However,  has some built-in obstacle avoidance capabilities and if it fails, it will generally be close to the goal. * (untested) Use the  package to calculate a good location for the manipulator's base. From the manipulator's position, calculate a mobile base location.

    json_prolog provides an interface to SWI prolog through ROS
    services. It is implemented in Java by using rosjava and JPL.
  








This package provides methods for querying the  ontology via ROS. json_prolog can load the  file of a ros package at startup. Just pass the corresponding ros package name as first parameter. Examples on how to use the different client libraries can be found in the  subdirectory. For interfacing json_prolog, the python client library provides the class Prolog as an interface for making queries and the class PrologQuery to encapsulate results. Solutions are python dictionaries that map variables to their bindings. Prolog lists are represented as lists. Atoms are represented as strings. More complex terms are represented as dictionaries with the sole mapping from  to a list of values. The first value is always an atom, i.e. a python string. The other values can be of any valid result type, i.e. again a dictionary containing a , a string, a list or a number. The main interface class of the C++ client is . It provides the methods: The class  provides a very simplistic container like interface to a sequence of bindings. In particular, it provides the methods  that returns an iterator to the beginning of the prolog result,  that returns a past-end iterator and the method  to close the query. Dereferencing a PrologQueryProxy::Iterator returns an instance of type . This class essentially is a std::map<std::string, json_prolog::PrologValue> that maps variables to their actual values. The PrologValue class is a wrapper around boost::any with support for the types To check if a PrologValue contains a specific type, it provides the methods To get the value as a specific type, the casting operator to the desired type and the method as<type>() are implemented. Lists are represented as std::vector<PrologValue>. Terms are represented by the special class PrologTerm which provides the following method: The method  returns a pretty printed representation of the contained value. Prolog expressions are either , , ,  or . All types apart from terms, lists and variables are represented by their native JSON format. Terms, lists and variables are represented as dictionaries with exactly one mapping. For terms, they contain a mapping from  to a list with the name of the term as first element and the parameters as the rest of the list. For lists, they contain a mapping from  to the (JSON) list of the members. For variables, they contain a mapping from  to the name of the variable. Strings should always be enclosed by \"" to prevent the JSON parser from doing something stupid. The following example shows how a the Prolog query  Please note that for calling the service , the outer map has to be omitted, i.e. only the list corresponding to the outer  must be passed to the service. init.plexamplestermtermquery(query_str,Â incremental=False)incrementalsolutions()finish()once(query_strjson_prolog::Prologquery(constÂ std::stringÂ &query_str,Â boolÂ incremental=false)once(constÂ std::stringÂ &query_str)json_prolog::!Prologbegin()end()finish()json_prolog::!PrologBindingstype()isValid()isDouble()isInt()isString()isTerm()isList()name()arity()values()operator[]toString~queryquery~simple_queryquery~next_solution~finishtermlistvariable~querytermrosrun json_prolog json_prolog comp_germandelimember(X, [1, 2, 3]), Y = foo(X){\""term\"":[\"",\"",{\""term\"":[\""MEMBER\"",{\""variable\"":\""X\""},{\""list\"":[1,2,3]}]},{\""term\"":[\""=\"",{\""variable\"":\""Y\""},{\""term\"":[\""foo\"",{\""variable\"":\""X\""}]}]}]}X = 1, Y = 2{\""X\"":1, \""Y\"":2}"

ROS camera driver for . Parameters are resolved starting with the driver's private namespace. If desired, they may be defined in some containing namespace. That is useful for sharing parameters with the  node. The  must already be running before any of these example commands. While you can run the driver in the ROS root namespace, the image pipeline prefers running each camera in its own subordinate namespace. These examples use the  namespace. With multiple cameras, use something unique to the device, like the camera name. Pass the network host name and password of the camera on the command line, assuming the default username (""root""). This example uses the  local  address, alternatively one could provide the static IP address for which the camera is configured. This publishes two topics:  and . To see the raw image, run  in another terminal this way: The  parameter is necessary, because the camera is actually publishing a motion JPEG stream, via the ROS  message. Wide-angle network camera lenses generally exhibit significant intrinsic distortion. For robotics work, it is very helpful to calibrate each camera and use  to provide rectified output. Since the driver produces compressed motion JPEG, and  expects raw  data, an extra step is needed to convert the data stream: To see the rectified color image, run  in another terminal this way: The  parameter is not needed in this case, because image_proc publishes its output using . Then, in a third terminal, run : Then, follow the instructions in the . The resulting calibration parameters will be stored in , which resolves to  in this example (assuming $ROS_HOME points to the default  directory). The next time the driver runs on the same machine it should automatically pick up the existing calibration information in that same location. You can store the calibration elsewhere by setting  appropriately for the driver. For example, to store it in a package named , append this to the driver's argument list: See  for details. axis_ptzroscoreaxis/axis/camera_info/axis/image_raw/compressed_image_transportimage_proc_image_transportfile://${ROS_HOME}/camera_info/${NAME}.yaml~/.ros/camera_info/axis_00408c8ae301_local.yaml~/.ros~camera_info_urlmy_calibrations $ export ROS_NAMESPACE=axis

W2360,https://wiki.ros.org/class_loader,Wiki,class_loader,"The class_loader package is a ROS-independent package for loading plugins during runtime and the foundation of the higher level ROS ""pluginlib"" library. class_loader utilizes the host operating system's runtime loader to open runtime libraries (e.g. .so/.dll files), introspect the library for exported plugin classes, and allows users to instantiate objects of said exported classes without the explicit declaration (i.e. header file) for those classes. 
 is a ROS-independent package that allows one to dynamically load exported C++ classes during runtime from a runtime library (i.e. .so/.dll file) and create objects of those classes. What makes a class loaded through  different from just linking against a runtime library and using classes from it is that your code does not require the definition of the class (i.e. the header file for the class) in your client code. Classes loaded in this fashion are also often called .  
 is used in the implementation of the higher-level ROS package  which is the encouraged method for loading plugins in the ROS  ecosystem.  
 is simple to use and requires linking against a single library (). 








  


 as of version 1.9 and class_loader HIGHLY discourage linking applications directly against libraries containing plugins. Often times users will place plugins into libraries along side code intended to directly be linked. Other times they want to be able to use classes as plugins as well as directly use them without a . This was fine in previous versions of pluginlib, but as version 1.9, pluginlib sits on top of class_loader for plugin loading which cannot handle this.  






  It is important to note that the  can only inspect classes and create objects of those classes if those classes are registered to be exportable.  For any classes you want to export, make sure to have a declaration of the following macro for each class within your source (.cpp) files: where  refers to the name of the class to be exported and  refers to the name of the class from which it is derived. Though you do not need the definition of the Derived class in the code that will load the class, you still need to have a definition to its base class so as to be able to use the plugin. Notice in the code examples that when introspecting the library via  or creating a plugin via  that both methods require a template type argument indicating the base class. If the correct base class is not given, the class will not be seen or instantiable by the . It is ok to have classes with different base classes registered or even register the same class multiple times with different bases in the same library and transitively the same . Just note the base class argument must be provided at compile time via a template argument for methods where it matters. Once you have built all your source files using the macro, you can package the object files into a runtime library and then load that library via the . All methods to  and  are thread safe. The use of templates allows for all types to be statically verified and it is impossible to load an invalid plugin with an incompatible interface. This is a powerful concept in guaranteeing the integrity of plugins at both compile and runtime which is of course very important in robotics. When one uses the  to create and destroy plugins, it results in the opening and closing of the runtime libraries containing those plugins. When a runtime library is loaded by an operating system, symbols in the host executable that are stubs to the runtime library are resolved. When the library is unloaded, the symbols at those corresponding memory addresses are unavailable as the code has been removed from executable's address space and [possibly] unloaded from memory. If one attempts to use symbols that are unresolved, it leads to a runtime link error. This means if I create an object from a class defined within a runtime library, I then unload the library, and then I try to use the object...things will go bad.  In the example code above, the library is loaded and unloaded by  automatically, though  provides methods for explicitly loading and unloading the underlying library ( and  respectively). The  is smart in that it will automatically load a library when created and unload it when the  goes out of scope. One may wonder why the load and unload methods are then exposed. In order to understand that, we must first understand the 's on-demand (lazy) load/unload mode. The  constructor provides an optional boolean flag () to indicate if the  is to perform on-demand (lazy) loading of a library as needed and automatically closing it after the last plugin in created by it is destroyed. By default, this flag is set to false. When set to false, the  loads the library at construction time and unloads it at destruction time. In on-demand mode, the library is only opened when the first plugin is created via  and unloaded when the only remaining plugin created by the  is destroyed. This mode is helpful when we want to minimize the number of libraries loaded in memory. It is often useful, particularly in on-demand mode, to control when the library is loaded and unloaded. One can force this by calling . When one calls  and , the library is forcefully loaded into memory and cannot be unloaded automatically by the system until  is called. This allows multiple threads sharing the same  to force a shared library, even if it's open in on-demand mode, to stay in memory until it's done. This is not a thread safety issue, but rather one for performance to prevent a library from continuously being loaded/unloaded if a thread is going to need it heavily for some period of time and wants to guarantee the library stays in memory. A  allows one to create objects in the form of  values so as to provide automatic cleanup of objects. Another one of the important reasons this is implemented is so that the user cannot unload the library prematurely. The user is free to create unmanaged objects via the alternate  method, but this will prevent the  from stopping the user on unloading the library when there are still objects in memory. This is because the  cannot be aware of the state of unmanaged instances. Many  methods will raise an exception of base class type  if an error occurs. The subclasses of  are defined in  and indicate the various problems. These include: The  is designed to be bound only to a single runtime library. Often it is convenient to have multiple libraries open and be able to load/unload classes from them through a uniform interface. That is why the class  is provided. This class provides as an almost identical interface to  but allows one to bind several libraries to a single loader object. Internally, the  is just a manager for a collection of  objects. The issue is that the way class_loader implements plugin introspection is by having plugin   automatically register themselves when the library is opened. This is not how pluginlib prior to version 1.9 operated. However, the problem is is that when you directly link an executable against a library with plugins, when that program starts up, all the plugin factories will be created outside the scope of a .

 The  package is a collection of ROS compatible drivers for the cameras installed on Care-O-bot 3. These include two color cameras (either of type  or ) and one  time-of-flight sensor from Mesa Imaging or the  sensor. All camera types are supported for Windows and Linux. To enable Windows compatibility, remove all  flags from  located at . The two Prosilica GC1380CH are natively supported by ROS with the  package. The binaries of the  package are executed within the related launch files. The same holds for the Kinect whose driver is located in the  package. Setting the camera parameters for the  and  is different from the suggested ROS standard. Instead of setting all parameters within the ROS launch file, camera specific parameters are set within IPA specific configuration files. This originates from IPA internal requirements to maintain backward compatibility to existing components. The ROS launch file only holds parameters related to the camera setup (e.g. specifying the used camera types) and a link to the IPA internal configuration file. In order to launch the camera nodes, do the following (Replace  with your personal Care-O-bot identifier) For quitting do not close the viewer window, but hit  on your console For quitting do not close the viewer window, but hit  on your console The IPA configuration file is located at  in a folder related to your sensor setup e.g.  or . The configuration is XML-based. It holds one XML-tag for each camera e.g.  for a AVT Pike C145 camera. The number within the tag-name is used to differentiate several camera of the same type. Here is an excerpt from the IPA configuration file of one of our Care-O-bots. Camera intrinsics may be set for each camera within the designated tags. The information is later published with the images using the ROS  from the  package. The user has the possibility of specifying different intrinsic for one camera. This is related to stereo vision, where intrinsics are optimize to fit to another camera. Within the ROS node that publishes camera images, the non-optimized intrinsic are published with the images. Extrinsic specify the rotation and translation relative to another camera. These parameters are not yet published and for IPA internal usage only. For each camera there is also a related  tag. This is also related to backward compatibility issues and not used within ROS. Originally, it provided support for loading saved image data from disk and using it as if it came from a real camera device. However, ROS already provides more sophisticated means to record and play back data using  and . ROS launch files are located in  and hold information about the overall sensor setup not related to a specific camera. There is a launch file to start each camera independently () and a launch file to start all Care-O-bot cameras at once (). Before you can start these launch files, you have to specify your robot id via  for example. Each launch file specifies the location of the related IPA configuration file and the used color camera or time-of-flight camera type. The robot specific launch and configuration files are located in the  folders. The following camera types are supported: The Prosilica GC1380CH color camera is supported through the ROS  package. To get more information, have a look at their tutorial.

    (IIDC) protocol. Supports the ROS image_pipeline, using libdc1394

This package provides a ROS interface for digital cameras meeting the  using , which supports . Of the thousands of IIDC models, we are accumulating a  with this driver. It works with the ROS  like other streaming . For help, please check . If your question is not answered, open a new one with the  tag, so we can see it and respond. To report problems or request new features:  The  driver was first released with ROS C-Turtle. That API is stable. Additional features have been added since. They are all compatible with the previous release, except for the default  value. By default,  requires the message timestamps for both images to match exactly, which the  driver cannot do. The Diamondback release of  provided a solution for this problem (enhancement ). The  had some significant limitations. Some have been removed in later releases. Please check the specific documentation for that release, if you are still using ROS C-Turtle. For each supported feature there is a corresponding  parameter providing user control. Different cameras handle these controls in various ways. When setting an IIDC feature to a specific value, it is necessary to set the corresponding control state to  (3), otherwise the corresponding value will be ignored unless the device is already in the  state when the driver starts. For example, to set  to 256 on the command line: Many IIDC cameras use  to provide color information. For cameras of this type, set  to an appropriate  value, and select the correct . If the  is , all  images are monochrome. Best performance is likely to come from using the default  method while running  and  nodelets both in a single process (see the  example below). In both cases the  image stream is compatible with the ROS . Format7 parameters specify image size, position and pixel format. Some Format7 modes may provide binning, combining groups of hardware pixels into a single image pixel. The Format7 Region of Interest (ROI) selects a rectangular subset from the full hardware image. These options sometimes allow the camera to send images at a faster rate. (The  parameter has no effect in Format7.) With an available  selected, a number of Format7-specific parameters  be supported, depending on the device: All these parameters are ignored when  is not one of the Format7 options. This driver publishes the same topics and provides the same parameters as the  version. Run a standalone , this behaves almost the same as running .   For that, see the following example. To run the driver nodelet and  all in a single address space with zero-copy message passing between those nodelets, use a  like this: Depending on specific needs, some of the  nodelets could be omitted. But, they do not incur much overhead when not being used. camera1394reset_on_openreset_on_openFalsevideo_modeframe_ratecamera1394camera1394stereo_image_procauto_brightnessvideo_modemono8bayer_patternbayer_pattern""""mono8bayer_method""""bayer_methodbayer_decodingimage_proc/debayercamera1394/drivercamera/image_rawimage_pipeline~frame_ratevideo_mode~binning_x~binning_y~roi_width~roi_height~x_offset~y_offset~format7_color_codingraw8~bayer_method~bayer_patternvideo_modecamera/image_rawcamera/camera_infocamera/image_rawvideo_modediagnosticscamera/set_camera_info~guidstr~reset_on_openbool~video_modestr~frame_idstr~frame_ratedouble~iso_speedint~camera_info_urlstr~binning_xint~binning_yint~roi_widthint~roi_heightint~x_offsetint~y_offsetint~format7_packet_sizeint~format7_color_codingstr~bayer_patternstr~bayer_methodstr~auto_brightnessint~brightnessdouble~auto_exposureint~exposuredouble~auto_focusint~focusdouble~auto_gainint~gaindouble~auto_gammaint~gammadouble~auto_hueint~huedouble~auto_irisint~irisdouble~auto_saturationint~saturationdouble~auto_sharpnessint~sharpnessdouble~auto_shutterint~shutterdouble~auto_white_balanceint~white_balance_BUdouble~white_balance_RVdouble~auto_zoomint~zoomdouble~num_dma_buffersint~max_consecutive_errorsintcamera1394_nodeletcamera1394_nodeimage_proc$ rosrun camera1394 camera1394_node _auto_brightness:=3 _brightness:=256.0$ rosrun nodelet nodelet standalone camera1394/driver<launch>

 To keep the communication with the Care-O-Bot platform variable (as different motors or CAN-hardware could be used),  implements the communication to different motors through a generic interface  and for different CAN modules through . The used CAN module is specified in an .ini-File, as well as motor-specific parameters. Each motor-object is loaded with appropriate parameters and during initialization each wheel is homed. After initialization, the user can easily command the platform using the provided functions of  like . It is implemented in  and again provided to the ROS network via services.

With these arguments you can control all of the Recorders features.  specifies the general task, you are going to set up: To avoid that effect, the user only has to start-up the read-out process. From then, the transfer process is running autonomously, triggered by the receive of data packets, which are led to the appropriate functions after having been fetched from the CAN-buffer. During such a segmented SDO transfer, the data is collected in the  collection class. It also holds some SDO-transfer-specific features like the state of the transmission. When receiving the last segment of a transfer, the collected data is handed to an adequate processing function. In our case, it's . Finally, the collected data is saved to a file; you also could imagine of keeping it temporarily in a variable to give the calling function the opportunity to process the data itself.

The configuration and setup for each diagnostic aggregator is specific to each robot and can be determined by users or developers. The two analyzers in this package,  and , hold and categorize diagnostic messages. They're useful for categorizing components or systems. They can warn when an item is stale, but do not do additional analysis of the diagnostics. Other analyzers can be loaded as plugins by the  on startup. The aggregated diagnostic output can be displayed in the  tool. The  displays these messages in a hierarchical format. To determine the hierarchy, the diagnostic aggregator prepends diagnostic status names with a path, joined with ""/"". For example: This shows how an  might categorize and analyze diagnostics data from a simple robot. Using the diagnostic aggregator, we can move these diagnostic messages into easy to understand categories to display in our . To do this, just prepend the name of the category to the status names, and separate them with ""/"". The  will load analyzers to store and process the diagnostic data. Each analyzer inherits from the base class . Analyzers must be in packages that depend directly on  and . The base analyzer class is the pure virtual  class. All derived classes must implement these methods: Analyzers can choose the error state for any  message they analyze and report. Generally, the ""parent"" of an analyzer has an error state of the maximum of its children, but some analyzers may have more advanced methods. The analyzers are responsible for correctly setting the names of each item they analyze. The  does not do any checking or enforcement of the diagnostic status name hierarchy. Users can create Analyzers to load as plugins for different robots. See the tutorial  for details. For a full tutorial, see the tutorial . Under each sub namespace under , a different analyzer is configured. Analyzers can be robot specific, or they can be general purpose ones like the . Each analyzer needs a special parameter, , in the namespace. The  parameter gives the  the class name of the . The  parameter (publish rate of ) is optional, and defaults to 1.0. The  is prepended to all  output, and defaults to """" (empty string). To look for an example of an aggregator in use, look in the ""diagnostic_aggregator/demo"" directory. Users specify each  in the private parameter space of the , then start the node.  In the  package, the two analyzer types provided:  and . The  can be used to categorize and track stale items. The  categorizes analyzers themselves, allowing users to ""sub-categorize"" analyzers. The  class is useful for categorizing diagnostics data.

For a full tutorial on the , see  The  can load a group of analyzers as a sub group. This can be useful for analyzing a group of similar items, like 4 different cameras. The  can use any type of analyzer as one of the sub-analyzers.  The above example can analyze the instruments on a PR2. The  uses the parameter  to prepend to all output names. In the above example,  All sub-analyzers should go under the  namespace of the . They should be specified in the same way that any diagnostic analyzer would be specified. Note: The diagnostic aggregator uses the  internally, which is why this is very similar to setting up a diagnostic aggregator. The  is a subclass of the .

The costmap is still favorable in conjunction with  since it fuses multiple range sensors with a global static map and some filtering might be applied. A naive approach to further incorporate the costmap is to take each occupied cell as point-obstacle. However, by integrating the costmap_converter interface the costmap is converted continuously during runtime and if desired the conversion is invoked in a separate thread. For that purpose the internal  node () might be employed. Currently, parameters are hardcoded. These are going to be substituted with changeble parameters in an upcoming release.

 is a replacement for the  plugin in package . It simulates an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) affected by Gaussian noise and low-frequency random drift. The orientation returned mimics a simple Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS) using the (erroneous) rates and accelerations. 



 simulates a GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) receiver which is attached to a robot. It publishs  messages with the robot's position and altitude in WGS84 coordinates. The reference point that corresponds to the origin of the gazebo frame can be configured using the XML parameters. The conversion between gazebo coordinates and WGS84 is done using a simple , which is accurate enough if you do not go far away from the configured reference point and if you do not want to use the plugin for polar regions. 









 This plugin simulates a 3-axis magnetometer like PNI Corp's . Like for the GPS plugin, the orientation of the gazebo frame can be specified via the referenceHeading parameter. Declination, inclination and field magnitude have to be configured depending on your location on earth. The default parameters are valid for Europe and North America without magnitude information (normalized vector). Check  for exact parameters. The  plugin is a ROS controller for gazebo's built-in ray sensor. The value returned as sonar range is the minimum of all rays, as a sonar ranger returns the distance corresponding to the first echo returned from a object within it's field of view. The behavior of this controller plugin depends mainly on the parameters of the sensor it is attached to. The <controller:hector_gazebo_ros_sonar> tag is only valid within a surrounding  tag.

UUID generation is up to the programmer, but the intent is for matching features within a domain such as Open Street Map to yield the same UUID.  The  package provides C++ and Python interfaces for generating them: use the  method on a URL constructed from the map source. Here,  is the decimal representation of the integer OSM node, way, or relation ID without leading zeros. The  service takes a map URL and optional , returning a , The map contains a  vector and a  vector. Each point or feature is identified by a , and optional  properties describing their roles.  Not all way points in a map are drivable by any particular vehicle. Some delimit buildings, rivers, or property boundaries. The  message represents drivable paths as a directed graph using a  vector and a  vector. Each segment represents an edge from one point to another.

     A force/impedance controller.

  








The controller is an open-loop Jacobian-transpose force controller.  At every point on the trajectory the desired stiffness or desired wrench is converted into a Cartesian force/wrench vector and ultimately into a joint torque vector using the transpose of the arm's instantaneous Jacobian matrix.  No guarantee is made to the  of the applied force/wrench/impedance because this is an open-loop controller.  There is currently not adequate feedback on the arm to determine the applied force/wrench/impedance.  Joint stiction, joint position limits,  motor torque limits, and sometimes the arm configuration (at a singularity, for example) will cause the applied force/wrench/impedance to deviate from the desired values.  Generally, unless the arm is at a singularity or a joint is at its limit, the  of the force/wrench/impedance will be correct. This controller should never be used directly; rather, all interaction with it should take place through the . In this video, the PR2 first moves its gripper to the center of its body and then applies a constant force in the  direction (towards/away from the robot).  As you can see, the force is light so the human can easily stop the motion.  However, with no intervention, the robot hand will continue to move as far in the  direction as it can go.  There is no sense of trying to achieve a goal in this direction.  This type of control is useful if you wish to exert a constant force against something. In this video, the PR2 first moves its gripper to the center of its body and then tries to extend the gripper about 25 cm farther away, but with low stiffness in the  direction (towards/away from the robot).  Since the stiffness is low, it is easy for a human to move the hand away from the center of the body in the  direction and it returns slowly.  In the  and  directions, however, where the stiffness is set to the maximum, it takes a lot of strength to displace the gripper and it returns very quickly to its set point.

Please check the  for common problems, or open an  if still unsolved. The best way to try  is using the demo provided in , see the . The  package provides a  layer plugin , and  client/server nodes  and . The provided nodes can be used to demo the functionality of the costmap layer by executing a frontier exploration task bounded by a user-defined polygon area. Layer  can certainly be used for more complex exploration tasks, functionality is exposed through two :  and . To run this demo on your host, see  section. Also, this video is an example of  integrated with  (). At this point the demo robot should start moving . If you just want to start taking advantage of the functionality of this package,  helps. If you like to understand a little more in depth, generally, when launched  will spin until it receives an exploration goal. To submit a goal: Once the server receives a goal, it will create the initial exploration map, start processing sensor/costmap data, and issuing  action goals. By default, the exploration task will explore all areas within boundary (whether previously visited or not). Sample launch files for several use cases are provided below. When running the action server/client without a global  information source, enable the  parameter to dynamically resize the map based on the action goal's polygon boundary. Error messages thrown up by  regarding the sensor being outside of map bounds will occur when the robot is traveling outside the exploration boundary. These can be safely ignored, and could be suppressed using  configuration files. If not using  (e.g. running unbounded exploration), make sure the costmap is configured with a large enough height/width. Sample launch file:  When running the action server/client with a global  information source (either from  or ), the exploration costmap will match size/resolution to the external map source map loaded by the static layer, so it is important to disable the  parameter and that the  of the exploration costmap matches that of the external /map. When exploring with , you must also disable  to prevent the node from re-exploring known areas. Sample launch file:  The  node executes exploration actions for any connected clients. It uses a  object to keep track of the exploration progress, and creates movement goals for  as necessary. frontier_explorationfrontier_explorationBoundedExploreLayerexplore_clientexplore_serverBoundedExploreLayerUpdatePolygonBoundaryGetNextFrontierfrontier_exploration/mapMarkerÂ pluginDisplaysÂ -->Â MarkerÂ -->Â MarkerÂ Topicexploration_polygon_markerPublishÂ Pointnexplore_serverexplore_clientexploration_polygon_markermove_base/mapresize_to_boundarycostmap_2drosconsoleresize_to_boundary/mapmap_servergmappingresize_to_boundaryglobal_framegmappingexplore_clear_spaceexplore_clientExploreTaskexplore_serverexplore_serverexplore_server/clicked_pointexploration_polygon_markerexplore_serverexplore_servermove_basemove_base~explore_costmap/explore_boundary/update_boundary_polygon~explore_costmap/explore_boundary/get_next_frontier~explore_costmappluginsBoundedExploreLayer~frequencyfloat0.0move_basemove_base~goal_aliasingfloatfrequency0.0~goal_aliasingmove_basesensor_range/2~goal_aliasing0.0frontier_exploration::BoundedExploreLayer~frontierspcl::Pointcloud<pcl::PointXYZI>~get_next_frontier~update_boundary_polygon~get_next_frontier~resize_to_boundarybool~update_boundary_polygon~frontier_travel_pointstringpose~get_next_frontierpose.positionclosestmiddlecentroid~explore_clear_spaceboolsudo apt-get install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-frontier-exploration ros-$ROS_DISTRO-navigation-stageroslaunch navigation_stage move_base_gmapping_5cm.launch
