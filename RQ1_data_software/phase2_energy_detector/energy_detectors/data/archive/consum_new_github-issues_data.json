Because the odom2 frame is rolled with respect to our odom frame, that yaw measurement is transformed into a pitch measurement in the odom frame. In this case, they're both right-handed, so we can apply the transform that describes the rotation from the odom frame to the odom2 frame, and voila, the yaw becomes pitch. I'll call this case C. Note, however, that the way I'd apply this transform is not the same as in case A. In case A, we're effectively adding offsets. In case C, we're actually transforming the measurements into a different coordinate frame.", "Now we repeat case C, but rotate it 180 degrees instead of 90. This is equivalent to the NED frame.

There bug in timesync on APM.", "I'm now trying to update to 0.15 by building mavros from source, but I'm getting this error when trying to build:", "Try to clean workspace first. Also i recommend to install ", " package and use ", ".", "Version 0.15 also require fresh mavlink package. With catkin tools you can simply clone release repo to workspace.", "for me it looks a little bit like running out of memory. Did you check your memory consumption during building, e. g. with top?", "Yeah I checked the memory issues and it is running low on memory when it tries to compile. I'm looking into making a swap space to see if that solves the issue, then I'll try cleaning the workspace as vooon suggested.", "Try ", " flag. Or setup distcc.", "So I added the swap space and that seemed to fix the issue because the compiler got further in the process, but now I'm getting a new error:", "I already mentioned that you need fresh mavlink. Also you must rebuild all mavros packages, not only ", ".", "Sorry, I must have missed the mavlink suggestion further up. I have since installed the latest mavlink from source. Updating mavlink and adding the swap space seemed to do the trick because all the mavros packages were able to build after the changes. The timestamp issue seems to be fixed because now I'm getting correct timestamps:", "Which looks like the correct timestamp. The weird translation is still present, but I'll look into that some more and maybe open a separate issue if I can't figure it out.", "One more thing before this issue is totally resolved though...", "When I run mavros I'm getting", "Is this something I should be concerned about?", "Nope. For first time that is ok.", "Weird translation - check what FCU sends in LOCAL_POSITION_NED.", "It repeats the \"Wrong FCU time\" warning every 10 seconds or so.", "Did you connected GPS module? Did it got fix?", "I'm not using a GPS module. The application is meant for indoors.", "So nothing strange in wrong time and strange position data.", "You can disable timesync and SYSTEM_TIME message. But you must feed FCU's position estimator with some data.", "\nIt might be optical flow position sensor (px4flow) or some ROS estimators (visual_position).", "Well the timestamp issue is figured out, which was the biggest problem.

Different applications can utilize different representations as they like but the data filled in populates the costmap, and the traversability map, and the ... based on whatever the application warrants.", "From talking about this again this week I had another thought which I'm sure others have thought about but maybe not in words:", "We would like to not have to redo different planning and controlling algorithms into different ones for different representations of costmaps. Rather than trying to make something like templating everywhere and trying to make everyone happy and readable, I'm thinking a good thought would be to have adaptors.", "For example right now we're going costmap -> planner. Now we might go costmap -> adaptor -> planner, similarly with traversability map -> adaptor -> planner. This lets us generalize all the new planning and control algorithms independent of the implementation of the world model (making those by itself is hard without having to deal with lots of templates and thinking about ramifications across multiple representations).", "Then we have a finite set of adaptors we need to build to represent the different models we'd like (costmaps, traversability, elevation, etc) who's job is to take the value of the neighboring cells and apply the vehicle kinematics and dynamics to give back a response \"ok\" \"not ok\" \"unknown\" or other options. The example adaptor for a costmap would be to change the 0-255 to those return types. Elevation map would apply the vehicle dynamics or maximum gradients to return the same type of information.", "Now all planners or controller that work for 1 will work for all as long as they can run with   \"ok\" \"not ok\" \"unknown\" or other options and be extendable easily for sampling based planners by creating methods in the adaptor to get the value at a certain location in global frame coordinates which the adaptor could project into a costmap cell, voxel grid pose, or elevation gradient.", "adaptors ... who's job is to take the value of the neighboring cells and apply the vehicle kinematics and dynamics to give back a response \"ok\" \"not ok\" \"unknown\"", "Are you envisioning the output of the adaptor in this example as a sort of simplified costmap where each cell is filled with a ok, not ok, or unknown value.

How confident are you that this is the right place for that knowledge?", "I had thought of having input and output adaptors as well, but I was thinking it could result N^2 adaptors since we theoretically could want to convert from any representation to any other. I expect it wouldn't be so bad in practice since many conversions are probably not useful.", "Based on your feedback, I was imagining something like this below. We have a collection of representations. Adaptors to convert incoming data to those representations as needed.

I'd recommend completely scrapping that, I don't see anything special about a laser scanner requiring that type of pipeline within the world model. If you'd like to use it as a safety sensor with zones, that should be up stream of this since that's not generalized and many robots today don't use them anymore or have a different sensor suite.", "What I think should be happening is a similar way of how it's done today. There's a set of optional plugins to buffer arbitrary sensor information  (scans, images, depth maps, radar, sonar, etc) when does stuff of interest for that sensor, and inserts it into the map. I'm not thinking greatly into how to generalize those plugins for different plugins. In practice, I dont think you'll find a way to generalize that. A costmap is binning a depth map for collision avoidance, while an elevation map will use them over time to generate an ellipsoid curve or something are very different operations on the same sensor data. Those plugins for buffering and inserting data into their representation are probably representation specific.", "Looking on the other side however, we have our [representation A] which needs to be utilized by the local/global planners to navigate. In the case of the elevation map, the Z coordinate becomes meaningful so we can't just talk about 2D X-Y coordinates anymore. The planner or controller will say \"give me the neighbors\" and its then up to the adaptor to say \"I'm an elevation map, therefore my neighbors are in a 3D 8-directional curves\" or \"I'm a costmap, I just need to give the cells on either side of me\", and return that information to the planner or controller to do their will with an ask for more things as needed.", "This lets us do 2D or 3D representations but allow the same algorithms for local and global planning to operate (and moreover, would work for drones as well). When the adaptors return their neighbors, its up to the adaptor's knowledge of the robot dynamics and mechanics to assign them some set of finite states that can be generalized across all representations. That might include OK, not OK, unknown, not recommended, etc but as long as all of the algorithms are built to work with those same finite states, then whatever the representation is, it'll work. And the adaptors can use the Robot class to get those relevant dynamics. For a diff drive robot, its just all OK like in navigation1, but for an ackermann car or an elevation map on a legged robot, that may not be valid", "I think what you are refering to as adaptor is what I have as a plugin below. We can later discuss the best pattern but the idea is the same, this block's goal is to translate the information available on the Core Representation and express it in something the client needs.", "Yes that's what I'm thinking, with the only exception that the \"Sensing and Perception\" isn't 1 plugin, but also a series of plugins, but I think that may have just been represented that way for brevity.", "Each representation will have an associated plugin that converts its values into the limited-enum types and is responsible for answering the query from the controller/planner \"give me the neighbors\" and \"give me the value at (x,y,z)\".", "I'm not sure why you have a separate pipeline for laser scans", "It was meant to represent a possibility. If a sensor could output data directly in representation format, it could talk directly to the model. But that's a stupid idea in context.

That means when you are driving it around, you are slamming the thrusters with max-thrust requests. (This is not a problem since the maximum is limited to something safe, but the autonomous controllers are always kinder than this).\n\nI watch the desired wrench on the screen at all time- it doesn't oscillate rapidly because the controller is PD + an integral.

MAVROS should do the same.", "Technically perhaps you could argue that it is not a bug but why limit WP precision to +/- 1m unnecessarily? With the proliferation of consumer RTK GNSS, this will become a serious bottleneck for precision navigation....", "\nThe same problem was recently addressed in Mavproxy. Wp pull also suffers from the same issue.", " waypoint plugin need huge revision to support MISSION_ITEM_INT and to support mission_type extension.", "\nAnd I'm thinking to spend my limited free time to migrate to ROS2.", "\nBut of course PR welcome.", " from the ROS side how should this problem be approached in terms of interface. Would you want to have the option available to use MISSION_ITEM or MISSION_ITEM_INT(I would think through the use of a flag in the message) or would it be better to do the change silently behind the scenes and keep the messages the same?", " it is possible to do param for: auto, mission_item, mission_item_int", " gets autopilot capabilities and it should be available trough UAS.", "\nSo plugin may check the state before start of sequence of requests and choose old/new message set to operate.", " when you mentioned the mission_type extension, was this in reference to adding support for the parameter in the ROS message or is there something that needs to be changed in the underlying mavlink implementation to add this Mavlink 2 extension? It seems like you already use it with the current waypoint_item implementation", " if you mean libmavconn, then no, it is already support v2. Just now mission_type is hardcoded to only one supported table - mission. While it is possible to setup more tables, but that require changes in the plugin (to support several mission lists). That would be nice to have, but probably that is another topic, because that would also break ROS API (messages).", " Makes sense, would it make sense for fence and rally points to be different plugins to maintain that API? I haven't written a plugin for mavros before, is it possible to have different plugins handle the same message and then throw it away if the fence plugin received a mission mission_type MISSION_ITEM? Something like this could let the waypoint interface stay the same.", "So after looking at the APM firmware (which is what I work with), it looks like they don't have the ability to send a MISSION_REQUEST_INT message but they just treat MISSION_ITEM and MISSION_ITEM_INT messages identically, by converting MISSION_ITEM into MISSION_ITEM_INT. This isn't too much of an issue if I use the parameter approach for deciding which MISSION_ITEM message to use but I'm not sure if other Mavlink conformant autopilot stacks would have the MISSION_REQUEST_INT message, and perform more closely to the protocol defined ", ". Can someone that works with the px4 or other stacks see if their firmware works in a similar way?", " How do other implementations select between sending a MISSION_ITEM_INT and a MISSION_ITEM if which one is used is actually dictated by the response of the flight controller after a call of MISSION_COUNT?", "I need to have a different int encoding factor depending on whether the frame is local or global. However, there is one frame (MAV_FRAME_MISSION) that I am not sure how it is used. In the ardupilot docs I saw ", " uses param7, traditionally altitude so not effected but its more of an example, would this be the type of mission_item that would use a MAV_FRAME of 2? I set the encoder factor of MAV_FRAME 2 to be 1 so any values with a MAV_FRAME of 2 would be unencoded but is this what MAV_FRAME 2 is used for or should I actually be encoding the values?", " the problem with different plugin is that it would be copy-paste of wp with some minor changes, and i do not like to violate DRY rule. Yes, it is possible to move some parts into the mixin, but, probably, it would be difficult to support. So i think that easiest way - to extend wp. But, as i said, support for different mission types not necessary to do from the beginning.", "I need to have a different int encoding factor depending on whether the frame is local or global.

", " what is your goal in terms of implementation support? Do you just want me to confirm it works for px4 and arducopter or are there others I should verify it works with? Due to the fact that Arducopter can't send MISSION_REQUEST_INT I will have to send MISSION_ITEM_INT in response to MISSION_REQUEST messages for ardupilot specifically and trust the MAV_PROTOCOL_CAPABILITY mask. But if px4 or another mavlink device support MISSION_INT in MAV_PROTOCOL_CAPABILITY but can send both MISSION_REQUEST and MISSION_REQUEST_INT I probably shouldn't send a MISSION_REQUEST_INT to a MISSION_REQUEST like I would for ardupilot.", " yes, PX4 and APM is enough. And yes, check for API quirk is fine, just leave a note in module comments about quirks, because it's easy to forget. Also you may leave a link to this issue."], "issue_code": ["sys_status"]},

The problem is that tf requires a time server, but Gazebo is the time server, but it is not publishing time values because it is still initializing the gazbo_ros_control plug-in. My current work-around is to check in update() whether tf-related initialization of the controller has taken place. If not, update() returns immediately. Otherwise, tf-related initialization is attempted, and a flag is set if it succeeded. The problem with this approach is that it possibly (Probably? Definitely?) will break the real-time constraint during the update() call during which tf is used.", "I've been thinking of setting up a timer callback in initRequest(), called once per second.
