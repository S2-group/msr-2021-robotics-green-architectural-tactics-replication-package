In the process I defined two additional ROS parameters:\r\n1) angle_error as a bool to determine if the plant_state has such a discontinuity\r\n2) angle_wrap as a double for use in accounting for the discontinuity.

The reason delta_t was 0 seems to be that the CPU was getting so overloaded distributing time at a rate of 250us per update that it was falling behind sometimes, and now and then the controller wouldn't get any time updates on /clock, which made the filter terms go to infinity.

Your PID module is just what I wanted for my robot. It's straight-forward and easy to use. I felt it would be improved if it had dynamic reconfigure of Kp, Ki & Kd to facilitate tuning the loop parameters. Also, the behavior of the plant and loop got a lot more interesting when I caused the setpoint to change periodically - it enabled playing with tuning parameters and watching the results on rqt_plot in a real-time manner. Is this an enhancement you're willing to merge into the upstream repo?\r\n\r\nAlso, did you announce this on the ros-users mailing list? Lack of a plain ol' pid has seemed like a deficiency to me.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nPaul", "pr_comments": ["PS I'm happy to * add to the wiki documentation if you like this work. After all, code is nothing if no-one knows what it can do.", "This is cool! Thanks for introducing me to dynamic reconfigure. I'm going\nto make some minor changes to some of the comments, add you as a\ncontributor, and update the ROS package. Feel free to edit the wiki.\n\nYeah, I did announce it to ros-users nearly a year ago. Unfortunately an\nauthor of ros_control (an earlier PID package) kind of attacked it. That's\nalright. The wiki page still gets about 20 hits/day, so it's definitely\ngetting some use. I've actually had an Israeli student contact me about\nusing it on a drone.\n\nAndy", "Thanks for the reply Andy. I'd looked at ros_control but it's way complicated and honestly I don't understand it and the tutorials are fairly incomplete and all I want for my lawn-mowing robot is a plain ol' PID controller that I can instantiate for each wheel and for desired pose. By all means make it better - I'll pull before I request another pull from you.\n\nI've come to realize there's a design flaw in pid: setpoint should be a distinct input message, separate from plant state. Typically, setpoint comes from higher levels of the ROS stack, and at a different rate, whereas plant state comes from lower levels: e.g. the encoders. I would like to separate them out, if you're ok with that. I understand this is a breaking API change, but it's important to separate plant desired state from plant actual state. If you have objections or input please say so.\n\nI'm also adding a second-order simulator, which will make tuning in simulation more interesting. A first-order plant is too easy to tune: just crank up Kp as much as you want and add a bit of Ki. You don't even need Kd. The provided plant doesn't even need any Ki because it doesn't have a load.\n\nI do believe in proper wiki documentation.  You can see my efforts in http://wiki.ros.org/swiftnav_piksi, http://wiki.ros.org/razor_imu_9dof, and http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_embeddedlinux among others.\n\nThanks\n\nPaul", "I can understand why having setpoint as a separate message would be more\nflexible. I will definitely approve those changes.

", "Trying to address Ian\u2019s comments from below:\n\n> its also not clear how this helps resolve the underlying issue.\n\nIn the current IoSM implementation, a single mutex protects both the queue data structures and the process\\_event queue. This is more restrictive than necessary, and makes it impossible for an action within the state machine to call `addRegularCommand`/ `deleteRegularCommand`.\n\nThe new version splits that into two mutexes:\n\n* the queues have a simple std::mutex, since adding and removing commands from them is neither reentrant nor thread safe.\n* boost::msm\u2019s process\\_event function is reentrant but not thread safe, so that is protected by a std::recursive\\_mutex. This makes it possible for events to spawn other events, and for an event to modify the queues.\n\n> This is a pretty significant change in locking semantics.\n\nYes. As we discussed in-person, it changes some things, but I don\u2019t think any of them are significant issues:\n\n* It is not guaranteed that calls to `process_event(StartCommand)` will immediately follow a change to the queue. However, since it will always eventually be called, this is fine.\n* Any programs that are modifying queues that involve commands with `forceNext=true` need to be robust to the second half of the command not being called as the set is being deleted. This isn't new \\(it was also the case when queues could only be modified by ROS callbacks\\), but it is something to be aware of if/when we write nodes that make use of this new flexibility to modify queues.\n\nWere there any changes that you could think of?", "Two more notes:\n\n* This might be a good time to create an integration branch, and merge all our changes into that for well testing, rather than merging these into master.\n* I ran`catkin_make run_tests,`and all the automated tests pass.\n\n", "Out of curiosity, what\u2019s the advantage to:\n\n```\n{\n  std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(some_mutex);\n  // do stuff\n} // lock goes out of scope and gets unlocked on destruction\n// do more stuff\n```\n\nvs.\n\n```\nstd::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock;\n// do stuff\nlock.unlock();\n// do more stuff\n```\n\nI see how std::lock\\_guard clearly communicates a mutex lock that\u2019s not supposed to be unlocked by the user, but if that\u2019s the goal what\u2019s the advantage to adding a bunch of indents?", "1.

You can see this yourself with the following code:\r\n\r\n\u200c\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n#include \"ds_base/ds_process.h\"\r\n#include <ros/ros.h>\r\n#include <memory>\r\n\r\nusing namespace ds_base;\r\n\r\nint main(int argc, char* argv[])\r\n{\r\n  ros::init(argc, argv, \"test\");\r\n  auto process = std::unique_ptr<DsProcess>(new DsProcess);\r\n\r\n  // Create some publishers\r\n  process->setup();\r\n  \r\n  // Calling the destructor here will cause a segfault when the internal\r\n  // DsNodeHandle is free'd\r\n  process.reset();\r\n\r\n  return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\u200c\r\n\r\nThis means anything that has a DsNodeHandle will cause segfaults when cleaned up.   This is just bad in general, but we haven't caught it yet because we don't generally delete DsNodeHandle objects before the overall process \\(linux process, not DsProcess here\\) is over.   But it does make unit-testing DsNodeHandle-based objects impossible.\r\n\r\n\u200c\r\n\r\nThis PR resolves the issue by doing the following:\r\n\r\n* Removes the DsNodeHandle class entirely\r\n* Moves the DsCallbackQueue object into the DsAsio class\r\n* DsConnection no longer requires any type of node handle\r\n* DsSerial and DsUdp *do* require a ros::NodeHandle, but only to be passed to their setup\\(\\) function.  No node handle is retained.\r\n* DsProcess::nodeHandle\\(\\) now accepts a string argument and returns a ros::NodeHandle \\(not a ds\\_asio::DsNodeHandle\\* pointer!\\)  AFTER replacing the node handle's callback queue with the DsCallbackQueue from DsProcess' internal DsAsio object.\r\n* Unit tests added to ensure proper cleanup after DsProcess quits.\r\n\r\n\u200c\r\n\r\nThe change to DsProcess::nodeHandle\\(\\) is the worst offender of this PR.  There's lots of \"nodeHandle\\(\\)->\" like code that breaks now that we're not returning a pointer.  I've gone through the following repos and pushed branches named \"ds\\_nodehandle\\_refactor\" for many **but not all** of the ds\\* packages.  \r\n\r\n\u200c\r\n\r\nThe following repositories have branches pushed with the required changes:\r\n\r\n* ds\\_base \r\n* ds\\_components \r\n* ds\\_control\r\n* ds\\_gui \\(no changes needed\\)\r\n* ds\\_msgs \\(no changes needed\\)\r\n* ds\\_sensors \r\n* ds\\_sim \\(no changes needed\\)\r\n* sentry\\_components \r\n* sentry\\_config \\(no changes needed\\)\r\n* sentry\\_control\r\n* sentry\\_msgs \r\n* sentry\\_sim \r\n\r\n\u200c\r\n\r\nWe can merge this PR once  everyone has their repos not listed above ready to go.

Unfortunately It turned out being a little too \"bulky\".\r\n\r\n1) I am working on a third solver based on qpOASES and to avoid errors and duplicated code, I propose to use a base class and to have ChainIkSolverPos_TL and NLOPT_IK inheriting from it.\r\n\r\n2) Some minor cleanups. Here and there. In particular, I suggest a more consistent namespace and less copy and paste. I also prefer less cryptic names. \r\nI understand that this might occasionally fall into the \"personal taste\" field.  \r\n\r\n3) A less misleading information from the benchmark test. Instead of informing the user of the average time including both successful and failed IK, inform only of the average speed of successful samples. This is IMO a less biased source of information, since it actually inform about the ability of the algorithm to converge. ", "pr_comments": ["May be this PR is too big, do you want me to split it in smaller ones?", "The main problem is that I have private v2.0 that we've been using on a commercial project, and I've been hoping to find time to make public,  that probably won't be consistent with any of this.  If you make it smaller, it might make it easier for me to also sync the changes into v2.0.", "Ok, I see. When are you releasing 2.0?\n\nMy main motivation for having a baseclass is to add other solvers, in particular [Ipopt](https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt), [qpOases](https://projects.coin-or.org/qpOASES) and [lma_kinematics](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/tree/kinetic-devel/moveit_kinematics/lma_kinematics_plugin)\nIdeally I also would like to select which one I use at runtime (yaml file?)\n\nAdditionally, I would also like to be able to extend the API to allow underconstrained IK, i.e task that control only 3 DoF or 5 DoF (very common in my use cases).\n\nLast but not least, it would be nice to add a secondary solver for redundant manipulation to find a solution that avoid singularities or reduces the amount of motion.\n\nAs you can see, I have a bold vision for this library ;)\n\nThe question is if we want to work together or if we have different goals or agendas.\n\n", "1) the solver already allows underconstrained ik.  If you set the bounds to be large (or fltmax) that dimension becomes unconstrained.  That was kind of the point of the original work on this.\n\n2) the manip-product condition already avoids singularities by maximizing manipulatity metric and pushing away from limits.\n\nI feel like maybe you are trying to push the API on this without really understanding what is already there.  Perhaps bounds and conditions could be better documented.", "1) Indeed, you are right. Forget what I said.\n2) Inspecting the source code it is really hard to understand how this is done. APPARENTLY you just run the solver multiple times, using random seeds, until you get a timeout. \nThis is a quite different from what I was thinking, i.e. exploring moving in the null-space of the first solution. Honestly, though, I have no data/benchmark to know which approach is more robust... yet ;)\n\nForgetting these two points, do you see any value in the ability to use different solvers? Which are the goals/improvement of 2.0, if I may ask?", "On  point 2, you are correct.  That is what I am doing, and it is different from exploring the null space directly.  The issue with exploring the nullspace directly using the nonlinear optimization is that the null space criteria becomes the function to minimze and the final position becomes a constraint, but given the large search spaces of 6/7-DOF chains, this doesn't converge in any reasonable time.  So, you are back to doing typical Newton-style gradient descent like KDL.  I'm not saying this is bad, but its kind of different from the \"style\" of TRAC-IK.    Additionally, in version 2.0, there is also collision detection folded into the solver as well, which makes the traditional search using the null space even harder.  This is why I've stuck with the apporach of \"find as many solutions as possible and then filter/sort at the end\".  \n\nI think the software could benefit from different solvers, but my plan for TRAC-IK was never a \"Framework\" to allow user to pick and choose at runtime.  Ideally, there would be a small, set number of solvers that have different benefits and advantages that run in parallel.  If we can show that new solvers improve the TRAC-IK solution rate even more (or reduce solve time), then I'm all for it, but I'd like it to just become the default state of the solver.  That said, it should be easier to swap in new solvers to do these tests -- either by substituting for one of the current two solvers, or to run together with them as a third solver.\n\nv2 has a Cartesian trajectory generator that takes the non-collision goal IK, either min-distance or manip-product condition, as provides a \"straight line\" trajectory between the start and end poses that is guaranteed to not have joint rollouts and not collide with obstacles (currently only self collisions, but I need to add a \"Planning Scene\" like MoveIt! has).  This is all completely independent of MoveIt!, but eventually it would be nice to make it a MoveIt! \"capabality\" plugin that could replace the underwhelming Cartesian motion default in MoveIt!.\n\nI'm excited about your enthusiasm in helping extend this.  Let's continue the discussion, and after this holiday week, I'll try to spend time next week at least getting a 2.0rc branch into the public repo for you to start examining.  Perhaps your Pull Request will merge in smoothly, but I suspect the header/API changed enough to where that isn't the case.\n", "ok, I guess that for the time being I will just close this and wait for 2.0", ""]},
