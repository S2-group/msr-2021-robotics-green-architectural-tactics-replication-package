", " basically calls abort service and computes a new task to the same goal from current position.

The abort service triggers the truncation of a trajectory envelope by the coordinator. Truncating means: (1) compute the earlies dynamically-feasible path point; (2) truncate the trajectory and its envelope there; and (3) communicate the updated trajectory to the robot via a call to updateTrajecotryEnvelope.", "Point (1) is done using the forward model of the robot - the same model that is used to ascertain, for instance, if a robot can stop before a critical section. In order for this estimation to be guaranteed correct, it makes conservative assumptions on the communication channel (that communication happens once per T_c, which is the period at which coordination happens). So this means that the earliest dynamically feasible path point at which to stop is the result of (a) the deceleration profile in the forward model, (b) assuming that the robot first continues at full speed for another T_c and then gets the updated trajectory at the next T_c. That is why you probably see a very long slowing down, sometimes even reaching the end.", "I have checked, the updated trajectory is indeed forwarded to the vehicle exec node, because the TrajectoryEnvelopeTrackerROS (which implements the interface between coordinator and robots) implements the method \"onTrajectoryEnvelopeUpdate(TrajectoryEnvelope te)\". This is, by the way, the same mechanism used to replan (that is, when replanning, the current envelope is truncated as explained above and a new plan is computed from that point on).", "So, in conclusion, if you want to reduce the time to stop when you send an abort, you could:", "reduce the T_c, which will make the whole system more reactive", "change the forward model to reflect the fact that deceleration can be done faster. But beware, this has to be a conservative estimate of the robot dynamics, otherwise, the system becomes unsafe.", "AT YOUR OWN PERIL: you could modify the call to truncateEnvelope in the abort service implementation. Specifically, this currently calls the method \"truncateEnvelope(int robotID)\", which makes sure that envelopes are truncated at the earliest dynamically feasible point; there is as of yesterday another method in the current master branch of cooridnation_oru which lats you choose whether dynamics are considered. This method is \"truncateEnvelope(int robotID, boolean ensureDynamicFeasibility)\", where setting the boolean to false allows to truncate at the curren tpath point. You then have to also send an emergency brake command to the robot, so that it does indeed stop as soon as possible by slamming on the brakes.", "Hope this helps, and sorry again for the delay!", "Cheers, F.", "Hi,", "\nNo worries, a good answer is always better than a fast one! Let me explain a little better.

I then made a node which provided the base_link to odom transform using data pulled from the gazebo model_states. This is accurate, but unfeasible for a physical platform deployment and will have to be revisited.", "With these tf broadcasters in place, an accurate map of the environment could be produced using either the gmapping or hector_mapping packages. This map is then fed to subsequent simulations using the map_server package. I then added an amcl node (feeding it a fixed initial position since for simulation we are always spawning the rover on the same spot on the map).  At this point using RViz you can overlay all of the topic information and ensure that the autorally correctly localizes itself on the known map and overlays the sensor (lidar) data correctly.", "From here I started working on the move_base package.

We saw the serial stream occasionally output good data if we reflashed it after it powered on, but eventually the device would begin sending more and more corrupt data, and eventually the device would disappear altogether. We are still occasionally seeing corrupted data in the serial stream with the new isolator, but at a much lower rate than what we were seeing with the old isolator, and the device does not appear to be dropping out as it did before. It might be a good idea to add a CRC for the chassis data, but that's a different issue/feature request altogether."]},

However, I don't clearly see how to capture that in any way other than with domain specific code in something like a \"shim\" node as you describe. I suppose you could just have a default set of capabilities which start with the server, but for the more complicated case like \"when the first /diagnostics publisher is created\" I think the only way is custom code. Trying to capture all the stimuli which might trigger a capability seems out of scope for the capability server itself.", "I've explored the shim node idea, and I'm now wondering about the possibility of dynamically supplied providers.", "For example, by default a platform could have the ", " interface with no provider, but a hardware introspection node could be monitoring the robot and detect when a Hokuyo or SICK scanner is plugged in, dynamically adding them as providers of the LaserSensor interface. Then, when a higher-level capability (eg, navigation) has need of the laser scanner, it starts it up.", " I see your point. In a more generic sense we need the notion of \"startable\" for each provider. So when someone asks the capability_server to start the ", " interface, it looks for the list of providers (which is static and based on the packages installed) and then prunes that list by the \"start-able\" attribute of each provider. Each provider can provide an executable which is run to see if the provider is start-able, such that the checking executable's return code indicates this. Then you could write a start-able checking script for the Sick provider which checks to see if the (a) Sick laser is there, either by hitting the system or by asking a \"hardware monitoring process\".", "This sort of goes against the design so far though, because the idea was always that the robot developer who setup the robot would configure the providers with implementation specific information and no dynamic behavior would be needed. For example, lets say that you connect to a sensor over USB based on the hardware ID (because you have more than one and they are otherwise identical). So you connect to each and check the ID, then hard code the correct ID into the correct provider launch file. IP addresses would be another example, lets say that you want the main ", " to be a particular laser on the network, then you could hard code the IP of that laser into the provider file.", "I understand that this philosophy of static configuration doesn't make a very flexible system when you are reconfiguring the robot a lot, but that just wasn't what we were thinking of when we designed this. Another path is that we could make tools for more easily updating the static configuration on a robot. These tools would look at the system and pick several static configurations (maybe even using templates) and combine them to setup the robot's current configuration. These tools could be rerun when the configuration changes and the list of providers would change. This doesn't help when you are rapidly or often changing the configuration of the robot, but it does help when you have many different configurations but change the setup infrequently.", "The benefit, from my perspective, of keeping the static configuration and augmenting with configuration tools is that you get efficient and simple execution of the capabilities at runtime, which is exactly what you want on a production system which is not changing. If at all possible I would like to provide the dynamic flexibility which is desired from you guys where the systems are changing frequently, but without sacrificing simplicity and efficiency for the static deployment case.", "Certainly we are back and forth on when the configuration should occur.", "Building a \"setup assistant\"-like app for compositing together a robot's URDF and launch files is a nontrivial undertaking, so we/I have been trying to figure out how to make do with run-time and launch-time solutions.", "I'm trying to imagine other scenarios which might demand capability providers be enabled or disabled\u2014\u00a0some possibilities:", "FWIW, I'd prefer any kind of detection scheme to be based on a named Python class with a specified interface, rather than an executable with a return code."], "issue_code": ["~reload_capabilities", "capability_server", "capability_server", "capability_server", "std_capabilities/LaserSensor", "LaserSensor", "LaserSensor"], "issue_quotes": ["Example use case is a platform which has separate indoor and outdoor pose estimators: the indoor one starts automatically by default, but once the gps fix topic is alive, user has the option to shut down the indoor one and replace it with the outdoor one.", "Further possibilities would have the user able to permanently change the default, perhaps by blacklisting the indoor estimator (file in etc?) or some other scheme less intense than having to uninstall the providing package.", "Our robots are far from static as each one has multiple optional accessories, and typically the driver for the supported accessories is already on the system.", "A list of Interface/Provider tuples to start by default seems like it'd be a great first step.

I am wondering if you have any advice on the best way to temporarily suspend localization (or if I am doing something wrong). I want to sweep the laser to build the 3d view but when I do it hector_slam interprets it as a movement of the base_link. I expected that since the tf between scan_frame and base_frame was changing hector_slam would know it wasn't a true base_link movement. So I thought possibly I could just stop doing slam during a sweep of the laser since the robot is stationary during that time anyway.", "After looking harder, it seems you are doing the transform that I was expecting ", ". So now I'm even more confused as to why tilting my laser causes the map to update in troubling ways.", "Here I am showing the slam_cloud, and it seems to be transformed correctly. It does keep the robot still for some time during the scan.  However when sees the floor up close it thinks it is a wall. Somehow I guess it matches and considers it a move.

Your experience helps.", "Also, I have problem with the current way to sink end effector into tokens. The arm works fine with default position of token pool.

The current code has no problem to hover end effector over the tokens, but arm slides slightly towards the body of Baxter while reaching down onto the tokens, even if the code tell Baxter to lower end effector straight down.", "My idea is that the computeIK() always allows a small amount of positional error in each invocation and always chooses the trajectory with least effort in joint rotation.

I'd like to provide videos but I don't have access to Baxter in winter break (southern hemisphere).", "I agree the adjustment based on hand camera is not 100% reliable. It suffers from change in lighting conditions. In our case, light could cause a specular on the token as it's made from acrylic. The hovering height and the initial position of the token in picture would affect it as well. Based on my experiment, may I suggest to use cv::moments() function to calculate the centre of mass of the \"O/X\" on the token. The current code looking for the left-est and top-est pixels to determine the outside rectangle of the token, which is prone to noise in the image processing.", "I had a illustration here. The left scenario shows the \"comfortable zone\" for baxter IK, where less joint efforts are needed to lower the gripper in each step. The right scenario shows the problem when token is too close to Baxter.  It's still reachable, but it involves more effort to move joints. Our IK is lazy and would think the goal is reached as long as the error is less than certain fixed amount. In this case, pointing the gripper towards robot body represents less joint effort and IK always prefer it. The error is negligible if the moving distance is long enough in each step. However considering calling to computeIK() 100 times per second and just lower it a few millimetres each time, the error accumulation may be considerable. I have no problem when I lower Baxter arm straight down in single step.", "\n", "This one is related to point 2. The error accumulation is not about IR, but the IK.

I have past experience with this kind of project but am not sure if there are any mathematical limitations to the way constraints are currently being applied to the null space. I understand that this solver originally did support dual arms but it no longer does? ", " The original CLIK code simply constructed a dual arm jacobian using the DH parameters from both arms that related the joint motions to the velocities of the second tool point in the first robot's tool frame. This Jacobian is straight forward to build by walking the DH parameters in reverse down from the first robots tool to its base then up to the first robot's tool in forward order. Two 6DOF robots provide 6 redundant DOF. Now if you want to have zero motion between the tools while they grasp an object, it must be in the null-space of this jacobian. Obstacle and joint limit avoidance are also projected into the null-space.

This is because the KF's mean output is based on an averaged delay while the CH at a minimal delay, which is always smaller or equal. As a consequence they deviate the more the larger the random transport delay's range is (roughly by half of the range's diameter it).", "The fact that the CH is larger her indicates that we are looking with a flipped perspective on this phenomenon (e.g. by looking somehow at how much the translators subtract from the receive time, which is larger for the CH because it can observe more of the actual transport delay and consequentially removes more). To be more specific I'd need to know more about the red values.", "This difference in mean is not a problem in practice because when estimating the remaining delay after translation this difference is observable and gets removed as a part of the estimated delay. Of course this means that the estimated delay depends on which translation algorithm is used(!). But that is inevitable given the original problem (AFAIK).", "Thanks for the fast reply! The blue lines are indeed the header stamp differences between consecutive stamps after translation. The red line is the header timestamp (as provided by the translator) subtracted from the receive stamp in the analyzer node:", "I guess it's a matter of convention if the subtraction should be reversed and thus signs flipped :) Of course, this additionally contains the transport latency of ROS topic communication (from IMU node to the analyzer node generating the output).", "What I'm aiming for is a little better understanding of how to choose CH vs KF and also how to choose a value for the ", " param.

An \"easy\" option that comes to mind would be using a global shutter cam with h/w trigger, a microcontroller time-synced to the PC and kalibr. If you have any hints about other options I'm open to suggestions :)", "And the \"analyzer node\" is just some node running on the same computer as the IMU node that you wrote to analyze the timestamps of the IMU?", "\nIf it is on the same computer, then that is indeed a confusing fact about this KF approach that you found.", "With this algorithm,  in average, the delta between the timestamp after translation and the receive time is close to zero (by design)!", "\nBut the translated component has a smaller random delay component (it removes partially the randomness from the timestamp - that is the purpose of the algo.).

This average transport delay (temporal offset) would fix this this confusing observation (the red line would be increased by this positive constant).", "The fact that the red line is not in average zero is actually because you don't compute that in the IMU node but in a separate node that receives a little later, i.e. the average of the red signal is pretty precisely the average transport delay from IMU node to analyzer node. The noise of the red signal is the sum of the two random transport delays, IMU to IMU node + IMU node to analyzer node, while the first is actually only visible, because it got removed by the KF or CH (the removed noise can be retrieved by comparing with the receive time -- after all it is the one that got corrected in the first place).", "Regarding this 8s period I can only guess. Maybe the CPU load or the USB bus's load (assuming it is USB) is for some reason of this periodicity? Or it actually comes from the IMU where there is a periodic change in the processing delay (the transport should not be IMO).", "\nAh, maybe, if it is USB, then actually it is because of the poling rhythm of the USB (prior to 3.0). When you poll with a fixed rate with a non-integer ratio compared to the emission frequency then the delay should vary periodically. That could be it. Maybe you can find the current USB polling rate and see whether it can explain the 8s period.", "For CH vs. KF: I would use CH (while switching about every few hundred seconds) for nice clocks that do not have strong higher order drifts. For very cheap clocks or those that have to sustain aggressive temperature changes the KF is better but might need tuning.", "Observing is the average offset is hard for an IMU. And yes, Kalibr + trigger or shutter signal could be a good practical approach to this.", "One more thing about finding this overage offset: Please note that it is rarely useful (alone).
