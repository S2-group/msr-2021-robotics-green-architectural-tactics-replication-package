Both of them were clogged with plastic residue from the discs wearing off into where the IR emits light.  This problem is caused by poor tolerances in manufacturing.  So, I rigged up a solution by adding extra washers in the hex bolts and a larger washer around the driveshaft to add a millimeter of clearance.  This allowed the encoder connected to motor 1 to work as expected, however, motor 2 still did not register any 'ticks' upon testing.  FYI, here is the code I used:", "Thinking the problem was one of the encoder assemblies, I swapped them just to be sure and surprisingly, motor 1's encoder still worked fine but motor 2 did not.  I also made sure all encoder assemblies had power, which they did.  Thus, I believe issue is in the encoder receiving end of the DHB-10 where motor 2 is connected.  I checked and double checked this and I am sure that both encoder assemblies work, and the problem is in the DHB-10.  Re-uploaded firmware to no avail.  Next plan is to bring in my logic analyser (at home, I'm at office) and compare encoder data signals.", "This makes two significant issues with the stock kit, on top of the fact that multiple wires, screws, and nuts were missing from the kit when I bought it.

I have a couple questions about the Propeller code.", "First, there is a delay of about 0.5 - 1.0 seconds when I use the joystick to drive the base.  To see where this may be cropping up, I edited the following line which is around 590 in the ROSInterfaceForArlobotWithDHB-10.c:", "//dprint(term, \"o\\t%.3f\\t%.3f\\t%.3f\\t%.3f\\t%.3f\\t%.3f\\t\", X, Y, Heading, gyroHeading, V, Omega);", "\ndprint(term, \"o\\t%.3f\\t%.3f\\t%.3f\\t%.3f\\t%.3f\\t%.3f\\t\", X, Y, Heading, CommandedVelocity, V, Omega);", "Thus, the velocity from the DHB-10 feedback, V, is compared to the CommandedVelocity at each time step on the ROS interface by adding a rospylog line to one of the scripts.  There is definitely a lag going on there--and I'd like to see what I do to fix it.", "The next issue is that when I am driving forward on my joystick, the timeoutCounter frequently becomes higher than the ROStimeout timer and it throws a clearTwistRequest(), resulting in an inconsistent halting of the wheels for 2-10 seconds.  This does not happen when I am driving backwards, but it does happen when I send rotate commands, where one wheel or the other is driving forward.  I tried commenting out the clearTwistRequest(), but instead of halting the robot becomes uncontrollable for that time period.  I think the problem is occurring in the serial buffer, and perhaps some characters throw more errors than others.

Better to delete the offending package and get a complete build and clean catkin_make rather than white listing the arlobot_msgs package as mentioned in issue ", ".", "Hello, that did work around the issue and I apologize for not seeing issue ", ". However I am still unable to get teleoperation working. When I launch teleop I can't get the robot to move. I can change speeds with \"q/z/w/x/e/c/\" but can't get the robot to move. I also tried using the \"quick start\" script, but had no luck. I even tried the option to ignore ping sensors, but it didn't work either. While running the script I kept getting this error: \"Error connecting to RosLibJS server: [object Event]\", is that normal?", "\nLastly, thank you for your quick response.", "Hi, No need to apologize. Glad that helped.", "\nHave you run the basic parallax arlo tutorials to make sure the motors and encoders are wired and work properly? If not, that is the first place to start.", "\nNext, I would try getting the robot to move running the ROSInterfaceForArloBotWithDHB10.c propeller code and sending it commands using a terminal program as outlined in direct2PropSerialTestLines.txt  I had better luck using the terminal from the Arduino IDE than other methods. This is a key step. Let us know if you can move the robot this way. Good luck!", "Hello, yes I ran everything you mentioned and it all works fine. The robot even moves back if I put my hand to close to one of the ping sensors. When I run the \"quick start\" script I don't get true/false for atributes for keys in \"telemetry\", but I guess thats because I disabled those modules like it is suggested in isssue ", ". Also I don't get anything in \"relays\". Thank you for your help.", "I'm not sure whether I have ever run the quick start script. I have never been able to get the robot to move using the arlobot desktop icon and web interface.   What has worked for me is:", "The last thing I did to get that to work was to add some DEFAULT_MOTOR_ADC_VOLTAGE code to per_robot_settings_for_propeller_c_code.h and ROSInterfaceForArloBotWithDHB10.c to cause a non-zero voltage to be sent to propellerbot_node.py, but these changes have been merged for some time.", "I have tried:", "roslaunch arlobot_bringup minimal.launch --screen", "\n", "\nroslaunch arlobot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch", "again and just realized something I should have said already, when I start: \"roslaunch arlobot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch\" in a new terminal I get an error in the 1st one:", "File \"/home/pixy/catkin_ws/src/ArloBot/src/arlobot/arlobot_bringup/scripts/SerialDataGateway.py\", line 65, in Write", "\nself._Serial.write(data)", "\nFile \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/serial/serialposix.py\", line 517, in write", "\nraise portNotOpenError", "\nSerialException: Attempting to use a port that is not open.", "EDIT:", "\nI seem to have a simillar issue to what geistmate had in issue ", ", where all of the commands are registering when I run \"rostopic echo /cmd_vel\", but I guess they are not being transfered via serial port.", "EDIT2:", "\nCould it be that another process is using that port, when I run \"ls -l /proc/[0-9]", " |grep /dev/ttyUSB0\" to see which processes are using USB0 port I get the following:", "\nls: cannot access '/proc/10378/fd/255': No such file or directory", "\nls: cannot access '/proc/10378/fd/3': No such file or directory", "\nNote that while I was running this I didn't have roslaunch running.

At first it looked like the next line was just overwriting the first one, but I am not so sure now. Also when I copy the suggested line for DHB-10 I am getting the expected odometry output, but the safety line seems to exist for only half a second or so and then it gets overwritten. Despite it, when I run the commands for the robot to move forwards/backwards/turn it still does so normally. I am plugging my activity board directly to a usb 2.0 port on my desktop pc.", "I have looked at some other issues and the google group and I found out I wasn't the only one having an issue with serial communication. Can you please test teleop on your own setup and if it works can you please tell me what configuration are you using (pc, laptop, Raspberry, etc.. and what os)? I have been looking through the scripts for serial communication and it looks like \"SerialDataGateway.py\" is trying to read from the activity board, before it is reset, but that doesn't stop the script and it continues forward.

I believe that \"self._clear_to_go(\"to_stop\"):\" always happens. It seems like the robot always \"thinks\" that it's not safe to move. It might be due to the same issues I had at the beggining with \"no module named msg\", especially \"ArlobotSafety\". You can work around it by copying the code from \"self._clear_to_go(\"forGeneralUse\")\" to \"self._clear_to_go(\"to_stop\"):\", but be WARNED that the robot won't stop if its near an obstacle and will crash into it unless you stop it.", "\nAlso my problem with serial connection still persists and it is limiting my teleop.

I am using a lenovo thinkpad laptop running lubuntu 16.04.1 I am connected to a USB 3 port.  Originally, I was getting tripped up at the top of the clear_to_go routine. I put in a bunch of rospy.loginfo statements and eventually figured out that it was the _leftMotorPower and _rightMotorPower that was preventing my robot from moving. You should be able to do the same and figure out exactly what is causing a problem in this routine. I would start with the conditions at the top.", "Hello, thank you for your help. I took a look and it seems motorsOn and left/rightMotorPower are false all the time. Also, the serial connection seems to work for 20 seconds, then resets for 5s and keeps doing it all the time. It looks like it is supposed to be like that, but just wanted to confirm. If it is intentional, do you know why is it like that. Does ROS send too much commands to the activity board so it overflows its buffer, or is there another reason? You can contact me at ", " if you don't want to prolong this thread.", "Hi. The robot will not drive if left/rightMotorPower are false. Chris accepted a pull request of mine that was supposed to fix this under certain configurations.", "\nI just found a link related to some potential serial port issues under linux that I had used before:", "\n", "\nCheck out what it says about Permission Issues and ModemManager.

I guess there should be an assigment of the camera_info_url to one of the other paths depending on the camera source used.

Looking at the code there's an if in the reconfigure which sets the cameraInfoManager if self.config['camera_info_url'] != new_config['camera_info_url'], and I suppose that at the time of running the node this has not happened.

I saw that you foresaw this in your urdf's by defining a distance variable for the last gripper_link, which at the moment is coincident with hand_link. I tried to change this, since it would make life much easier for grasping something.

I'm currently testing different options for warehouse robot path planning, and this projects seems very promising. We are working with real robots, so the proof of concept has to be practical. One caveat for my scenario is that the width of some of the paths through the test environment is relatively wide compared to the size of the bots, so the constraint that only one robot may pass through a \"vertex\" at a time doesn't always hold and should ideally be a function of the width of the path segment instead. Are there any suggestions on how to incorporate this into the system? I can potentially contribute towards this if it isn't too paramount.", "Awesome. I'm not at ROSCon ATM but some of my colleagues are, though I imagine they are probably very busy with their own presentations. By any chance do you have links to the code where this is implemented? So I can go through the interfaces and how it's supposed to work etc.", "I tested the voronoi graph generation on a gmapping SLAM map of our test environment, it works. Though moving forwards, I think it would make sense to manually CAD the overlaying search graph instead, since the environment is relatively static, there are places that we don't want the bots to go, and sometime's the auto-generated graph isn't so robust to noisy laser measurements manifesting in the gridmap. Something as simple as manually supplying the widths the segments file would suffice.", "Be aware that I published yesterday minor changes on the graph generation. The graph should be smoother have a look at the map_invlation parameter."]},

For example, escape behavior will switch to car behavior when a clear line of sight is found, but when would car decide it too should drop its last plan in favor of something else?", "This is probably not necessary enough to warrant an issue. And more threading complexity may not be wise."]},

This should create the default view for my ROS demo.

For the command GUI, set move_type to 'drive' and then send various goals (and for fun, increase the last option 'speed_factor' to something greater than 1).

I used to have the rewire step too but it slowed down tree growth so much (Python isn't too fast...) that I decided to abandon that step for my real-time applications. You'll notice that one of the open Issues here is to re-implement \"star\" (rewiring) in an effective way. Unfortunately, I probably won't get around to that as I am caught up with other work. Thanks for checking this out though! You may also notice that many of my demos use a constant cost-to-go matrix for LQRSteer, which effectively reduces them to using the most basic form of kinodynamic RRT. Again, the reason for this was because solving a Riccati equation every iteration was too slow for my applications."]},
