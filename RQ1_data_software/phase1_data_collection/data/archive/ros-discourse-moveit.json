{"title": "The MoveIt 2 journey (part 0): why MoveIt 2?", "thread_contents": ["This is the first of a series of articles that we will produce to describe our learning experience and contributions with the MoveIt 2 and ROS 2 communities. The MoveIt! motion planning framework is an open source software for motion planning, manipulation, 3D perception, kinematics, control and navigation. It\u2019s built on top of the Robot Operating System (ROS) and altogether, according to its maintainers, remains the third most popular package in the ROS world. MoveIt! provides an easy-to-use platform for developing advanced robotics applications, evaluating new robot designs, and building integrated robotics products for industrial, commercial, R&D and other domains.", "As MoveIt! evolves beyond R&D environments and starts getting integrated into more and more commercial and industrial products, it\u2019s only natural to look for improvements and seek alignment with groups attempting to use ROS on industrial and commercial environments.", "Over the last years some groups have extended ROS to obtain different degrees of determinism (e.g. [1]), however these attempts ended up with complex and use-case specific architectures that were never fully adopted by industry. As described at [2], ROS started in November 2007 as the development environment for the research-oriented Willow Garage PR2 robot. Due to its research nature, ROS did not considered many aspects relevant for industry. One of such was real-time compliance. ROS was never meant to guarantee deterministic responses, critical for an improved motion planning experience.", "With complete understanding of these limitations, around 2014, Open Robotics started designing a new version of ROS called ROS 2. Such version aimed to deliver upgraded features when compared to ROS 1 and was officially released the 8th of December, 2017. ROS 2 has been extended enabling support for teams of multiple robots (or robot modules), small embedded platforms or primitives to enable real-time robotic systems.", "As one of the companies leading the transition to ROS 2 and as the company behind ", ", the first modular robotic arm that runs ROS 2 natively, the use of MoveIt! seemed natural to us. While MARA can be operated ", " with MoveIt! (see ", ") through the ", " ROS package, it was always our desire to provide the best experience. And this brought us to ask ourselves: Why MoveIt 2?", "Our motivation:", ". While this can be fine tuned, doing so is technically complex. Moreover, it generally requires to have a powerful-enough computer and, even in the best case, unnecessary latencies (due to the layers of abstraction) appear in the overall control chain.", ". ROS 2 delivers upgraded features when compared to ROS 1. It has been extended including support for teams of multiple robots (or robot modules), small embedded platforms or primitives to enable real-time robotic systems.

It\u2019s only natural that we aim for a motion planning framework that can similarly also operate in a ROS 2-native manner.", ": Open Robotics performed an initial analysis [3,4] of the capabilities one could achieve with ROS 2 in terms of determinism. These articles already highlight the importance of the computer architecture, the underlying operating system or the communication middleware used. All these aspects need to be taken into account when designing a real-time distributed system. This matter was further investigated by our group at [6,7,8,9] where we evaluated and characterized the ROS 2 responses on a (an embedded) system while researching and optimizing the underlying communications middleware (DDS), the Linux Networking Stack, the Linux operating system or the base link layer towards the creation of a firm-real-time capable distributed system based in ROS 2. Focused purely on ROS 2 layers (ROS Client Library (rcl), ROS middleware layer (rmw), etc.), Maruyama et al. [5] conducted an experimental study aimed at comparing the performance of ROS and a preliminary version of ROS 2, under different types of Data Distribution Services (DDSs). More recently, member of Apex.AI wrote a short introduction[10] summarizing optimizations required in the ROS 2 layers such as the use of safe data types, split memory allocation in init and runtime phases, remove all blocking calls or implement real-time safe log output handler among others.", "\nAll these optimizations are but pre-requirements to obtain real-time distributed motion planning over ROS 2. It\u2019s also required to optimize the motion planning framework itself. This will and end-to-end real-time motion planning experience.", "\nMoveIt 2 is the place where to do so.

This project, with coordination with PickNik Consulting, Open Source Robotics Foundation (OSRF), Dave Coleman, and Mark Moll, has been developed for the purpose of improving and extending the currently existing planners in MoveIt!. An existing concept of planning adapters in MoveIt! was used to have a pipeline of two planners running sequentially to provide robust solutions.", "Prior to summer 2018, MoveIt! only had a single stable motion planning library as its core motion planner, i.e. OMPL. As a part of this GSoC project, motion planning support was extended by making other motion planners (CHOMP) more stable and porting STOMP also to be a part of the MoveIt! motion planners family. The MoveIt! part of STOMP was ported from the ", " repository into the ", ". Furthermore, the benchmarking package was made to work with other motion planners in addition to OMPL and its ", " were added.

This enables the user to use motion planning algorithms in a pipeline to produce better trajectories in different situations. For instance the user could specify a start  and a goal location in RViz and then 2 motion planners could be run in a sequence like OMPL followed by CHOMP implying the usage of a CHOMP Optimization planning adapter. So OMPL would produce an initial motion plan which is then used as an initial trajectory guess for CHOMP to further optimize. Likewise, other motion planning pipelines that are possible by using the Planning Request Adapters concept in MoveIt include: (i) CHOMP + STOMP, (ii) OMPL + STOMP; (iii) STOMP + CHOMP; (iv) OMPL +  CHOMP. The first 2 of these involve using the STOMP Smoothing Planning Request Adapter and the later two use the CHOMP Optimization Adapter.

I envision a future where everyone has access to the economic prosperity of robotic manipulators.", "A few weeks ago I attended an open source conference where I led a discussion session I titled \u201cStability vs Growth: Breaking API\u201d. I presented to the audience of diverse projects a problem I believe we\u2019ve been struggling with in our ROS and MoveIt! community: stagnation and irrelevance. After speaking with many attendees, I came away with the belief that our now 7 year old project is stuck, making only minor incremental progress since Willow Garage shuttered its doors in 2013. Meanwhile, the robotics world has raced forward.", "There are many reasons I believe MoveIt! is facing this innovator\u2019s dilemma, and I want to outline some of them here with the public declaration that we at PickNik intend to change this, with your help. We see an exciting future for MoveIt!, and we believe we can transform it from a stagnant open source project, to a globally recognized platform that enables organizations of all sizes to leverage robotics for their applications. Before I outline the solution, I want to clearly state some major parts of the problem:", "MoveIt! has not yet officially been declared 1.0, yet we maintainers typically take the stance that API should never be broken, even in new distro releases. API must be broken for us to make the progress necessary for major new features like constraint-based planning, underconstrained Cartesian planning, and tighter integration with low level controllers. A recent SwRI effort came to the same conclusion, stating that \"Early on in the process several limitations were found in both MoveIt!\u2019s Kinematics and Collision environment\u2026 requiring significant API changes across multiple repositories\" [1]. By not incrementing major release versions, I believe we are severely limiting our ability to innovate.", "The MoveIt! policy has always been to run development out of the latest ROS distro *-devel branch, which I usually create right after OSRF announces the ROS distro as \"released\".

Companies building a product have more resources (or promise of them) than volunteer contributors. In order to innovate, I ask we shift our priorities away from stability and more towards growth.", "I believe we can take MoveIt! to the next level of motion planning capabilities by creating a more frictionless experience for contributors to make necessary and important changes to MoveIt!. This can be accomplished through following well-established software development practices such as incrementing major versions of software and working from an actual master branch. The various pain points that will arise in this process can be mitigated via clear communication (i.e. announcements on Discourse) and clear documentation (i.e. keeping the migration guide up to date).", "PickNik is committed to growing MoveIt!: for example we\u2019ve put effort into new tutorials, a new website, and hosting 3 GSoC students this past summer [2].

The workshop aimed to give an opportunity for MoveIt!/ROS developers to come together to share their experiences, projects, and plans while also exploring collaboration possibilities and working together to fix outstanding issues for the future growth of MoveIt! and industrial robots in China. Approximately 210 technical experts attended this workshop, including technical leaders from 30+ industrial companies (industrial robotics, smart manufacturing, machine vision, etc), professors, researchers and students from 7 universities, and ROS/MoveIt! community developers. ~7300 viewed the workshop\u2019s online video stream.", "It is the first time that MoveIt!, the globally renowned open source project, was represented in China. Intel OTC brought MoveIt! expertise to Chinese developers by preparing technical content and a hands-on workshop, while EDO bridged the resources of speakers and audience through its smart robotics ecosystem developed over the past 3 years, which covers ~300 ecosystem partners. By the close collaboration of EDO and OTC, the workshop had significant impact on developers and ecosystem partners by presenting a full picture of open source robotics, including authoritative technical methodology, influential academic perspective, typical industrial application as well as inspiring case studies.", "In the morning, 6 industrial / community leaders and university professors delivered technical sharing, focusing on MoveIt!, industrial robot applications, smart manufacturing, and collaborative robots:", "In the afternoon, about 120 attendees joined a MoveIt! hands-on activity.
