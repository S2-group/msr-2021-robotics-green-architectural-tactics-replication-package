It also provides tools and libraries for obtaining, building, writing, and running code across multiple computers.", "The main advantage of ROS is that it allows manipulating sensor data of the robot as a labeled abstract data stream, called topic, without having to deal with hardware drivers.

It will cover several topics ranging from basics and foundation to advanced research papers. Tutorial, survey and original research papers will be sought. The book will cover several areas related to robot development using ROS including but not limited to robot navigation, UAVs, arm manipulation, multi-robot communication protocols, Web and mobile interfaces using ROS, integration of new robotic platform to ROS, computer vision applications, development of service robots using ROS, development of new libraries and packages for ROS, using ROS in education, etc. Every book chapter should be accompanied with a working code to be put later in a common repository for the readers.", "EDITOR", "\nEditor:Anis Koubaa, Professor, PhD", "\nAffiliation:Prince Sultan University (Saudi Arabia)/CISTER Research Center (Portugal)/Gaitech Robotics (China)", "\nContact:akoubaa@psu.edu.sa", "\nBio:Anis Koubaa is a Professor in Computer Science in Prince Sultan University (Saudi Arabia), a Research Associate in CISTER Research Unit (Portugal), and consultant at Gaitech Robotics (China).
