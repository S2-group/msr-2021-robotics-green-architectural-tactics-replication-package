The requirement to reflash the BIOS is also understandable, but maddening - I run Linux, not Windows 10, so finding a machine to flash the BIOS is a pain.  It also seems that more than one person has had to flash the board multiple times before it boots.  Installing Ubuntu - that was worse than it should have been.
