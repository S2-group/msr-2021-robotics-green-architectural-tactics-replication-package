However it\u2019s very important due to the potential for discontinuities in localization estimates.", "The inspiration to have an inertially consistent coordinate frame came from my experiences in autonomous cars in the early Darpa Grand Challenge days. For safety purposes cars must remain operational with full navigation even if global localization fails. There are innumerable reasons for failures they can range from foreseeable ones like driving through a tunnel, to the periodic alignment of all visible GPS satellites in a single line that prevents triangulation. Even if you\u2019re doing localization based on ground features, it\u2019s quite possible that you\u2019ll encounter a construction zone or other new or modified environment where you don\u2019t have enough premapped features to track. This is fine for a while if you\u2019re localization goes forward temporarily in dead reckoning mode everything will degrade slowly at the limit of your odometric estimation. The challenge comes in when your localization system locks in again after you\u2019ve been dead reckoning. You now find out that you\u2019re off by 1m globally. So you adjust your position estimate in the world by 1m. But what about that vehicle that you observed in the oncoming lane, is it now 1m to the left too? If you\u2019re tracking it\u2019s velocity and estimating where it\u2019s going, it looks like it just make a 90 degree turn sideways at high velocity. Because based on the observed global positions it just did. Even thought the laser saw it 10cm closer in the oncoming lane and your IMU told you that you moved forward 10cm since the last update so you can estimate that it\u2019s actually stopped in the odom frame. Suddenly you cannot distinguish between a stopped car and one in the process of cutting you off and you slam on your brakes to avoid a stopped car in the other lane.", "In general localization provides you with the best estimate of your current position and it\u2019s solution is not expected to be continuous. The jitter in the localization directly translates to blurring of your mapping if you track your objects in the localized frame. The level of jitter from odometry systems is usually much smaller and as such you can operate with much smaller tolerances. From the PR2 use cases this is the difference between being able to drive through a doorway with a few cm clearance on each side while having a few cm localization noise. This same sort of scenario could play out when a car is looking to drive through a narrow tunnel exit. As the localization fix improves the walls will suddenly get blurred and the car will likely consider the road too narrow to drive down.", "ROS nodes which require odom frame such as gmapping,amcl,robot_pose_ekf etc\u2026, almost all of them cannot use with Autoware.", "\nSo, I think Autoware shold not follow all rules of REP 105.", "\nIf we follow all rules, Autoware architecture becomes too complex.", "There\u2019s also a significant benefit to following the standard as well for general interoperability. It is true that you are unlikely to leverage those specific nodes that implement this standard. But the reason that they all implement the standard is because it\u2019s important to the functionality of the system. And looking forward there may be other systems implemented which you may want to leverage from other projects and if you follow the standard and they follow the standard you will be compatible in the future.", "In general any time you\u2019re facing a decision and there\u2019s a common standard I would strongly recommend that the default be to use the standard and a strong argument must be made as to why to diverge from the standard. \u201cBecause it\u2019s too complicated\u201d is not a strong argument.

The only problem at the time was that it was convoluted accessing the underlying data from the lanelet2 API to build each message, but now we have more experience with the API it should be relatively easy. As far as usage goes however, I don\u2019t know if it makes sense to structure the data in messages.", "Regarding an ideal structure for map messages oriented towards use, I conceptually agree, but in practice, how we use data is largely defined by the internal format. The messages being passed are being consumed through the internal format. If it makes sense to build a ideal message format, then why not build an ideal map format?", "I disagree that much code duplication would occur even if every node that utilized map data in an unstructured Lanelet2 format has to do some sort of decoding - this is the purpose of shared libraries. A single encode and a single decode function should exist (or be created) in a shared library which can be linked against by any nodes needing to handle Lanelet2 format data. The decode function would return a class structure holding the in-memory representation of the map (or subset of the map) which can be manipulated as-needed by the consuming node and the encode function would simply return the encoded, unstructured data which can be published. Minimal code duplication.", "On a related note, I agree with ", " - a structured representation of the data being passed around doesn\u2019t serve much practical purpose with the design of Lanelet2 having such a strong decoupling of the primitives from what a grouping of primitives represent. The overhead inherent in encoding/decoding them as structured messages and the additional bandwidth required for the metadata are also non-trivial. Given that network I/O is second only to disk I/O in order of the most expensive operations you can perform on a modern computer, I lean heavily toward unstructured transport. I also think the actual implementation of how we access the map or a subset of the map (making requests to a server, segmenting the map, etc.) are somewhat irrelevant to representation of the data at the transport layer. Whether we split this up into multiple nodes or have a single server handling the map, they are still passing around the same basic datum and, in the case of Lanelet2, those datum are not easily reconstructed into the objects they represent without the structure of the Lanelet2 class objects.", " Hi, I guess the idea of code duplication concern arose because of the suggestion that some nodes might not want to link to the lanelets shared library, and instead work directly on the message data. If a shared library is to be linked anyway, we may as well use lanelets, or might there be a need for a lighter encoder/decoder lib with less dependencies?", "Assumptions:", "If you do not know how the data will be used, you should not make this assumption.", "Message data must contain enough information to reconstruct LaneletMap data structure", "This places no requirement on the message data itself being in the Lanelets structure.", "Message should be flexible enough to be used in different use cases. e.g. message should be able to express custom tags without changing message definition", "Message should be scalable. e.g. It should be able to represent subset of a map.", "Detailed Use Case:", "These are not detailed.

In a similar manner, nodes using the map data without lanelet2 library would have to reconstruct the lanelet data for it to be useful, leading to replication of code as Mitsudome-san mentioned. Perhaps excluding the lanelet2 library would be desirable for very lightweight nodes?", "The other consideration is that structured messages could be useful for topic level debugging. My initial reaction is that map data is only coherent viewed at higher levels, and that viewing the contents of individual primitives may not be so helpful for debugging. I it might be useful to verify that well formed data is being sent, or that a particular type of lane is being sent. Perhaps visualization tools would be more helpful in this regard? However, I certainly can appreciate that topic based debugging could be useful, and am open to including structured messages if others think in necessary", "We could support both? For certain cases it might make sense to debug using the structured messages, or that structured messages might encapsulation useful subsets of map data. In other cases binary data message is fast and easy.", "All nodes that access to map data should use Lanelet2 library. Although you mentioned about flexibility of using data without lanelet2 library, I think we should access to the map through the library if you don\u2019t have any critical reasons. This would keep us from having similar codes everywhere in Autoware.", "Define those use cases.", "Be very careful about allowing custom data in messages.
