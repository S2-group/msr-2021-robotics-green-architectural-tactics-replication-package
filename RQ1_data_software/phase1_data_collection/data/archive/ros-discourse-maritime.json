It wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to learn from them in that aspect.", "The discussion seems to be centered around a discussion thread: ", "Many common UAV messages are already available in the std_msgs package, so it looks like effort has focused on developing REPs (105, then 147) to codify best-practices.", "This discussion is showing that ROS is less mature for underwater vehicles-- which makes sense, that thread is older than the marine robotics SIG!  Presumably some combination of REPs and AUV-specific message standardization is required.  Some code development for rviz plugins and/or common drivers would really help drive adoption.", "I\u2019m just concerned that if ROS adopts a few messages without broader community involvement we\u2019ll continue a lot of very isolated development.  We just wrote yet another RDI DVL parser because none of the existing messages-- including the one proposed-- meets our needs.  We\u2019re at least the second group well-suited to being long-term maintainers of such a package to do that in the last 18 months.", "Maybe we should try to identify a venue for an underwater robotics ROS workshop?  A lot of the new stakeholders are new to open-source software, not just ROS.  Many of them don\u2019t even comment on the mailing list.", "I think a workshop is a great idea. Like you said, if just a few people contribute their implementations the problem isn\u2019t going to be solved. Maybe it would be possible to organize a workshop in some of the upcoming robotics conference/events?", "Hi, well the auv_msgs was indeed to be used on a higher level, but we can consider if it is possible to expand the functionality.
