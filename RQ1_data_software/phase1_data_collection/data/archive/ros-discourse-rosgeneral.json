This worked fine for that 1 specific compile (except for build files being put in funny places), but after that, cmake had cached the build settings which conflicted with those that colcon was trying to use, and cmake just ignored the colcon setting to use the cache. To fix the problem, all that needed to be done was to clear the cmake cache (the cmake equivalent of make clean).", " shared a link to a general discussion topic about moving ROS2 over to a pure CMake environment.I still contend that for a tutorial, the build environment is a distraction, however pure CMake would help to improve the situation a lot. CMake is quickly becoming the defacto standard for many platforms, and as such, would be easier for some of us to transition to. (Disclaimer: I work for Kitware).", "I appreciate all of the responses, and to be clear, I am not necessarily expecting any particular action, and I am absolutely not suggesting that the default for ROS2 be anything other than the build environment as you have built it. For most (all?) new projects, I think that the current default build environment makes reasonable sense. That having been said, it is always a good idea to give users more flexibility when you can, especially developers, and I can think of several cases where the single build environment would be more hindrance than good. The first and most obvious is for a legacy project where they want to add ROS2. That project already has its own build environment, and porting that entire project to use colcon would be prohibitive at best, and would most likely make the change a non-starter. A second example would be conflicting with other projects that have incompatible build requirements. For example, incorporating anything involving GPGPU processing or multi-language environments generally already have their own build systems in place that, in some cases, do not play nice with CMake. Merging ROS into such a project would be a royal PITA. Granted, these other projects are as much or more at fault for picking a non-standard build system, but I think you see where I am going with this. Another use case is for embedded systems, where one of the packages in a system belongs on an embedded device. Due to the nature of cross compilation, it is almost always easier to have a standalone build system for the cross-compiled parts. As you can see, it is easy enough to keep separate workspaces for each of these examples, but under these examples, the colcon build system provides no real value added.", "One thing I do want to be sure to convey is my appreciation for the documentation.  In my experience good quality documentation is hard to write and hard to find, but the plethora of ROS/ROS2 documentation has been a happy exception to that norm. Being able to find most of the information I need without resorting to google-fu has been very refreshing.", "Thank you again for the wonderful replies. You have built a really powerful tool in ROS/ROS2, and it is clear to me that no matter what decisions are made, there are dedicated and capable people working to make ROS2 better, and that is what really matters.", "That having been said, it is always a good idea to give users more flexibility when you can, especially developers, and I can think of several cases where the single build environment would be more hindrance than good.", "This is an interesting statement, because it is actually the opposite of how I think about the ROS build tools.", "One point that I keep coming back to (and maybe not explaining well) is that tools like Make, CMake, SCons, etc are inherently single-project tools.  That\u2019s fine, that is their goal.  But ROS is set up in a much more federated fashion, where you have many projects that you combine in different ways to achieve your goals.  So while I wouldn\u2019t stand in the way of anybody trying to improve the documentation and tools for the single CMake case, in my mind it just doesn\u2019t fit in well with the federated nature of the ROS ecosystem.", "That being said, I\u2019m glad that you solved your problem.

{"title": "Planning future ROS 1 distribution(s)", "thread_contents": [" Open Robotics intends to create a ROS 1 distribution in May 2020 targeting Python 3, but we\u2019ll need your help to make it successful.", "In the recent past ROS 1 distributions have been created by Open Robotics (OR) once every year in May. On even numbered years a ROS distribution came with 5 years of support (long-term support, or LTS), while in odd years with only 2 years of support (non-LTS). Since the non-LTS ROS distributions are not being used much by the community OR decided ", " to not proceed with non-LTS releases but only release an LTS ROS distro every two years.", "In light of ROS 2 gaining more traction the ", " recently came up what this means for ROS 1 releases. The discussion includes both perspectives (this is just a brief description of the two major directions):", "On one hand the majority of effort and funding is being spent on ROS 2. So instead of splitting the attention no future ROS 1 distros after the already released Melodic should be made.", "On the other hand there is a large community using ROS 1 with no (immediate) plans to migrate to ROS 2 and ROS 2 is not as feature rich and complete as ROS 1 at this moment.", "We need to carefully balance the pros and cons for future ROS 1 distributions. On the one hand we want both ROS versions to coexist for as long as feasible to allow a migration over time, but on the other hand we are bound by resource constraints. Here we mean not just OR but all ROS 1 package maintainers, wherever they work. As has been ", " by ", ", each new ROS 1 distro creates an initial development and subsequent maintenance burden for anyone who releases their packages for that new distro. As ", " ", ", OR doesn\u2019t receive funding directed at this kind of work, and I would guess that the same is true at other organizations.", "Looking at the current state of ROS 2 it has certainly gained a lot of features in the core and many porting efforts of important capabilities (like navigation, moveit, image pipeline) are on the way. That being said there is still some way to go to before it can match up with ROS 1 in various areas, just to mention one area: ", ".", "Looking at the current support timeline of ROS 1 the latest distribution Melodic was released in 2018 and will be supported until 2023. While that gives us a timeline of 4.5 years in principle, there are two factors which limit the effective support horizon:", "At some point in the future ROS 2 will target a newer version of Ubuntu (namely 20.04). Commonly for ROS distributions that happens for the next ROS distro released after the Ubuntu LTS becomes available. While the concrete point in time is up for discussion, at some point that move will happen - very likely before 2023. Then not having a new ROS 1 distro targeting a newer version of Ubuntu would leave us in a \u201csplit\u201d situation: the latest versions of ROS 1 and ROS 2 would not be supported on the same Ubuntu distribution which would make using a heterogeneous system much more challenging. As such this split would also make any gradual migration effort more difficult. This aspect shrinks the supported time window to the overlap between ROS 1 and ROS 2 distros on a common platform which is less than 4.5 years - more like 2-3 years (also ", " by ", ").", "The second aspect limiting the effective support window of ROS 1 Melodic is the ", " in the beginning of 2020. While existing distributions and packages will continue to exist, the unavailability of security patches moving forward will likely significantly hinder the ability to continue using Python 2 software. So the effective time window becomes even shorter - more realistically something around 1.5-2 years.", "Based on these considerations OR has decided to commit some resources to creating a ROS 1 release, code-named Noetic Ninjemys (Noetic) in ~ May 2020 which will target Python 3 (instead of Python 2). The availability of that ROS 1 distribution will address both limitations described above and effectively ensure a coexistence of ROS 1 and ROS 2 until at least 2025. While in 2022 new ROS 2 distributions will likely target newer Ubuntu distros (which are not supported by ROS 1 Noetic) that is less of a problem for the coexistence / migration since by then we certainly expect the ROS 2 release from 2020 / 2021 to be a viable platform users can stick to. (At the moment that is much less the case while significant features are still being worked on and previous releases are not necessarily in a viable state to be used.)", "That being said the transition from Python 2 to Python 3 in ROS 1 is certainly a significant one. While OR will contribute to create a Noetic release in 2020 the scope of work is much higher. It requires the whole community to contribute to the effort - otherwise Noetic would just contain a fraction of packages of previous ROS 1 releases or if not tested extensively the quality might be subpar.", "In the context of a ROS 1 Noetic release and ROS 2 porting effort you can see the Python 3 transition as a benefit to both worlds. Either a package is first being made compatible with Python 3 for Noetic and then ported to ROS 2, or a package is first ported to ROS 2 (which involves making it work with Python 3) and then the Python 3 specific changes can be ported for the Noetic release. Either way the step to Python 3 is necessary.", "As with any ROS distribution, it\u2019ll be up to package maintainers to decide whether and when to release their packages into Noetic. And as always, all community members will be welcome to step up and help to get package(s) released. If you see something missing from any supported ROS distro, consider volunteering your time to help with the release. If it\u2019s a package that you deeply care about, consider volunteering to become a co-maintainer or even to take on sole maintainership. You\u2019re very likely to get a positive response from package maintainers. And given the extra effort because of the Python 3 transition, we expect that we\u2019ll need much more such community assistance than we\u2019ve had in the past for Noetic to become a complete distro.", "What does that mean for ROS 1 beyond Noetic? At the moment OR can\u2019t commit to continue investing resources into future ROS 1 releases past Noetic. So OR does not intend to spend effort on a O-turtle ROS 1 release. If there is significant interest from the community this should by no means imply that there can\u2019t be more ROS 1 releases. All the infrastructure is open and if one or multiple entities would like to take on the responsibility for rolling future ROS 1 distributions OR will be more than happy to help them getting started with that effort.", "We hope this provides a clear direction for ROS 1 for the foreseeable future and some level of certainty what to expect from OR.", " thanks for this detailed roadmap and high-level outline on how people need to contribute. Has anyone already built a table of Python3-compliant ROS packages?", "I do think that the Python 2-3 migration challenge is just an extreme case of a more general characteristic of ROS package distribution and organization. While ROS-based systems are supposed to be loosely-coupled (i.e. all you need are matching message MD5 hashes), the way that ROS binaries are distributed creates ", " coupling through system dependencies. Namely, all released ROS packages must link against the same system library binary versions, even though this is only really necessary for packages that are linked at compile- or run-time.", "Do you know if anyone in the community has developed a robust toolchain for running subsets of ROS packages in isolated environments? I\u2019ve seen some examples with Python virtualenv, chroot, snaps, and Docker, but there\u2019s nothing that I know of others using in practice. This might east not only the Python 2-3 migration, but also running heterogeneous ROS/ros2 systems.", "As an aside, I really have a hard time reading \u201cOR\u201d as anything but a logical disjunction\u2026", "Has anyone already built a table of Python3-compliant ROS packages?", "I expect that ROS 2 enabled packages will be registered for the upcoming ROS Crystal release. At that point they will be browsable on ", "Thanks for this, ", ".", "That being said the transition from Python 2 to Python 3 in ROS 1 is certainly a significant one. While OR will contribute to create a Noetic release in 2020 the scope of work is much higher. It requires the whole community to contribute to the effort - otherwise Noetic would just contain a fraction of packages of previous ROS 1 releases [\u2026].", "Do you have any suggestions for how one might find projects that could use help in this?", "At some point there will be a buildfarm for ROS 1 Noetic which automates the testing with Python 3 and indicated which packages have failing test.", "Until then you need to build any set of ROS packages using Python 3.

So we rely on ROS and ROS-Industrial packages, plus some third party drivers for hardware, specific libraries etc\u2026 We have our own Continuous Integration Buildbot server that generates a Debian from the catkin-install output (on different slaves to account for the linux/ros-distribution mix).", "When we need to set-up a new machine, we need to install ubuntu, ros, then our script to install all the required libraries and dependencies, and finally install our Deb. Then start working, developping and customizing the final application for the robotic cell deployment.", "So, building a Docker container to host all this looks like a great solution to provide a clean install of our product/solution both internally or to our external partners/clients. Another option would to provide a kind of Vagrant or Chef cookbook to automate the correct deployment of a new machine, external libraries script execution and my product deb installation\u2026 (any opinion on the most suitable strategy?)", "However, and this is the point where I\u2019m getting lost on the usefulness of Docker for my usecase, our product is NOT meant to be working isolated and alone\u2026 It\u2019s a collection of ros nodes to allow easier programming and deployment of industrial robotic cells. So it can be seen as library to be used by our developers and clients.", "So If I am a user of this product, having a docker component would be great to start. But then I would develop my own robotic application/installation using this product + extra drivers form other Ros repo + my own nodes and application-specific Guis, my own config files and programs etc\u2026", "So, to my current understanding, I could \u201csave\u201d all this in my local version of the docker container\u2026 but when the official product docker container is updated, I would then loose all my specific configuration and application, right?", "Or should I create a new docker container for my own developments ? and ask my clients to control Docker programming to be able to create their own application?", "As you can see, I fully get the benefits of the docker container when the objective is to use something completely \u201cclosed\u201d or ship an application that is just meant to be ran/executed.", "But I dont\u2019 get the \u201chow-To\u201d when I need to work on top of a third-party provided container\u2026 And maintain the integrity of my work\u2026", "Can someone fill out the blanks in my (mis)understanding?", "Thanks a lot in advance!", "Damien", "(I\u2019m not a Docker expert, so the following may be due to my lack of insight into current Docker best-practices and / or capabilities of the system)", "I think Docker can be useful in your situation, if you use a container to Dockerise your ROS API (and the pkgs and nodes that implement that API). The container(s) would contain your pkgs and their dependencies + a way to launch them (remote ", "?). Then clients can write ROS applications \u2018against\u2019 that container. This avoids the lengthy setup process of all your pkg\u2019s dependencies (and their dependencies, ad inf) on your client\u2019s machines (as they would only have to pull the image).", "It may not work that well for things that are not part of the ROS API level, such as libraries and headers exported by packages, as it\u2019s not so clean (imho) to expose directories from your container to the host. Msg/svc definitions can (and should!) be put in separate pkgs anyway, so clients can install those outside the container without needing all the other complex bits.", "Some difficult aspects that might reduce the return on investment here: access to hardware (possible, but involved sometimes), complex networking setup (but Docker compose exists) and versioning of containers vs individual packages & nodes.", "( including a comment by ", " from the ROS Answers question):", "But how would they write these Ros apps against my container: would they need a full desktop install of ROS on their machine? and my container only contains libraries and my own nodes? or would they create another container with their nodes?", "That\u2019s what I alluded to with \u201cdoesn\u2019t necessarily work that well for things not part of the ROS API\u201d: developers will need a ROS install, but they won\u2019t need to install all your dependencies or follow the complicated setup for those dependencies. Personally I don\u2019t like to develop inside a container, but it can be done.", "Compare this to how you work with Baxter, it runs a ROS compatible interface, but you don\u2019t have access to, nor get to install the sources for the packages running on it. There are developer packages, but those use a ROS API to communicate with the on-board computer(s).

I haven\u2019t really seen them used for distributing libraries and header files (other than as a basis for other overlayed containers). The idea then is to avoid having to repeat a complicated setup and configuration process on each host where you\u2019d like to run those services on.

To this end the ReApp Engineering Workbench, an eclipse based development platform, was created.

{"title": "New metapackage ros_opcua_communication", "thread_contents": ["In recent years ROS grow over research institutions and started entering the industry. One of the problems becoming evident is integration of ROS-runned systems into existing industrial infrastructure. One of common standardized communication stacks used in industry is OPC UA providing the interface between different levels and components in a productions system. In 2015 the OPC UA Fundation opened all the documents of the standard for everyone interested and through that gained new independent open-source implementations. For that reasons in European project SkillPro (\u201cSkill-based Propagation of \u201cPlug&Produce\u201d-Devices in Reconfigurable Production Systems by AML\u201d) OPC UA as communication protocol was chosen. It enabled communication between heterogeneous devices running on different systems. The research group Intelligent Industrial Robotics at KIT-IAR-IPR uses ROS in its robots therefore there was a need to develop interface between ROS and OPC UA. Result of this work is ", " metapackage. The metapackage currently uses two different open-source implementations of OPC UA stack: \u201c", "\u201d written in C++ and \u201c", "\u201d written in Python. The package based on \u201cfreeopcua\u201d implements an OPC UA client with basic capabilities for reading and writing variables and calling methods helping user by automatic remapping of ROS built-in types into OPC UA basic types. The \u201cpython-opcua\u201d based implementation is more advanced and implements OPC UA server which creates structures for ROS messages and services enabling communication from OPC UA Clients to ROS. This enables easier integration of ROS components into existing industrial infrastructure, but also creates possibility to secure communication between two or more ROS-Masters over the internet since OPC UA communication is build with secure communication in mind. In the future support for parameter is planned and modeling of ROS-Type as OPC UA-Types.", "Powered by ", ", best viewed with JavaScript enabled"], "url": "https://discourse.ros.org/t/new-metapackage-ros-opcua-communication/995"},

The objective of the third volume is to provide the reader with comprehensive references on the Robot Operating System (ROS), which is currently considered as the main development framework for robotics applications.", "ROS (Robot Operating System) has been developed by Willow Garage and Stanford University as a part of STAIR project as a free and open-source robotic middleware for the large-scale development of complex robotic systems. ROS acts as a meta-operating system for robots as it provides hardware abstraction, low-level device control, inter-processes message-passing and package management. It also provides tools and libraries for obtaining, building, writing, and running code across multiple computers.", "The main advantage of ROS is that it allows manipulating sensor data of the robot as a labeled abstract data stream, called topic, without having to deal with hardware drivers. This book intends to fill the gap and to provide ROS users (academia and industry) with a comprehensive coverage on Robot Operating System concepts and applications. It will cover several topics ranging from basics and foundation to advanced research papers. Tutorial, survey and original research papers will be sought. The book will cover several areas related to robot development using ROS including but not limited to robot navigation, UAVs, arm manipulation, multi-robot communication protocols, Web and mobile interfaces using ROS, integration of new robotic platform to ROS, computer vision applications, development of service robots using ROS, development of new libraries and packages for ROS, using ROS in education, etc. Every book chapter should be accompanied with a working code to be put later in a common repository for the readers.", "EDITOR", "\nEditor:Anis Koubaa, Full Professor, PhD", "\nAffiliation:Prince Sultan University (Saudi Arabia)/CISTER Research Center (Portugal)/Gaitech Robotics (China)", "\n", "\nBio:Anis Koubaa is a Professor in Computer Science in Prince Sultan University (Saudi Arabia), a Research Associate in CISTER Research Unit (Portugal), and consultant at Gaitech Robotics (China).

On the other hand, a graphical designer frontend was not prioritised and never eventuated - scripting a python tree remained simple and flexible enough to suit our needs.

It took three iterations of the core libraries to pass that point, but since then there has been negligible change in the core libraries.", "Additionally, the trees started being used beyond the scenarios they were originally designed for. The control engineers started shifting all non-reactive control logic to the trees - it was just easier to follow patterns already implemented and to make use of the bagging/visualisation/replay tools, e.g. implementing an entire subtree for initialisation from a composition of context switches (small dyn. reconfigure changes), enabling/disabling of sensors and simple motions instead of having a separate c++ or python node that would handle the entire process as a custom state machine inside an action. Also, as the logic accumulated in the trees, the data to support it also centralised there, and it eventually became the natural portal point between robot and server/web applications.", "All the py_trees packages (py_trees, py_trees_ros, py_trees_msgs, rqt_py_trees) are on the ros build farm and repository details on the ros wiki.

I got a Raspbian-based Raspberry Pi 3 running a Docker container for Xenial/Kinetic to control a Turtlebot.", " ", " l I\u2019d like to help them get merged into the official ROS repo. They depend on a base Ubuntu image I built myself [2], which is just the regular amd64 base image, but using these [3] as the root filesystem. What would be the best path to have these Docker images merged? I suppose tweaking the Docker templates would be enough and have them point to the Ubuntu image I built, but I\u2019d rather transfer that to something more official (e.g. either Ubuntu\u2019s or OSRF\u2019s Docker repo)", "Cheers.", "1 - ", "\n2 - ", "\n3 - ", "Hey ", ",", "We\u2019re already building base docker images for all the non-standard arches that ROS supports here: ", " They are named ", " or ", "These are what we use as the basis for the buildfarm builds and tests on non-amd64 arches.", "The scripts to generate them are not easily discoverable but are here: ", "There\u2019s some cleanup to promote the generic branch and probably rename the repo to not say 32bit since this script now generates amd64, armhf and arm64 builds of both ubuntu and debian. It evolved but since it\u2019s a tool we use internally we haven\u2019t taken time to clean it up.", "For getting ROS builds based on those images into the docker registry our challenge is that we use the docker hub automated builds, and when I last looked into it they did not support building non x86_64 builds automatically.

The internet connection is limited here in Algeria and we couldn\u2019t perform a smooth remote manipulation on a robot, so the idea was to reduce the amount of TF sent from the manipulation server (remote site) to web client. I was able o reduce over 70% of bandwidth consumption with the same effective result as by tf2_web_republisher. I experimented my algorithm on pioneer mobile robot P3-DX and on the 07Dof robot arm Cyton_gamma_300. Now I intend to publish my results on an international review, the problem is I can not find a journal that accepts these kind of work for reviews, it\u2019s either: \u201cthere\u2019s no reviewer for ROS development\u201d or \u201cmy work is not a general contribution in robotics\u201d or \u201ca contribution on an open source tool is not useful\u201d!

Furthermore (this is an issue I still see today) most software that is written for a ROS software integrates ROS in a way that you can\u2019t use it without ROS even if it is just a hardware driver.

Furthermore (as stated in your article) it introduces standard messages for certain kinds of data. That means I can simply replace a Sick Laserscanner with a Hokoyu, start the fitting driver and the system still works.", "I don\u2019t know what kind of robot system you build, but in case other people want to integrate it into their own environment ROS might be a huge advantage.", "Amen!  That story mirrors my own experience.  Neither approach is absolutely better or worse, they are each inherently better at solving different types of problems.  Some realtime problems are just silly to try to handle abstracted away from the source of the events.

We\u2019re actually working on making that work together with ROS better.", "That said, I know that most compute and sensor platforms are far from being the major contributor to the BoM that Pulu makes them out to be.

Their sensors are not safety-rated, and their chassis presents serious crush and tear risks. This kind of work is easy to underestimate.", "The OTHER problem with ROS is that it only address what I call the \u201cmiddle layer\u201d.   It is not good for low level hardware control.  It leaves uses one their own for that.   It is also not good for the higher level decision making that I would call AI.  So you and up building bridges at both ends.", "The other huge complain is the complexity of the dependancies and the build system.  It is such that only \u201cexperts\u201d are able to port ROS to new platforms, even if the platform is very much like Linux, say BSD UNIX or MacOS.  It is basically a house of cards, one tiny problem and nothing works. In theory a distributed system that depends on massage passing should not be so tightly coupled.   I should be able to build a ROS node on using some OS I just invented and plug it into a years old ROS system and it should \u201cjust work\u201d.  Every last bit of ROS should be ablate be build independently and the only interface should be the text of the massages pass.   Itshould not all need to be built in the same work space.", "Perhaps it is a cultural thing and we could correct this by hold a frequent \u201cplug fest\u201d.

Probably not (IDK), because as some already said we need to tackle the problems on a lower level. Do we make the situation worse by teaching them \u201cthe wrong way\u201d? IDK.

Our robots will, it seems, be less expensive than the pulurobotics robots and on almost all fronts have greater capability.", "Why did we choose ROS? Well its simply a case of enabling a great user experience and development speed for the user. Before we built ROS based robots we built monolithic designs like the pulurobotics robot. We built an application called party-bot that looks around the room and uses face detection to find people to serve drinks to (see the video on our website ", "). With the monolithic design we had a team of 5 people working on it for several days to get a first prototype. Then it took us ages to tune it and it never really worked very well.", "With the ROS design, it took 1 person 6.5 hours to get to the first prototype. We tuned it in 1.5 hours using the many ROS tools and it worked well fast.", "Yes ROS has a steep learning curve - that\u2019s something we as a community do need to solve. Yes it takes a long time to make all the parts of your robot work properly with ROS - that\u2019s something that is a result of the fact that ROS forces you to think properly about the architecture of your robot.", "To claim though that ROS is too heavy weight, just ain\u2019t so! We too run our entire ROS stack on a raspberry Pi 3. In fact you can download our ROS image for the Raspberry Pi 3 here. ", ". Our software and stack is great for running robots, but also great for just hooking up say a camera or other peripherals. We get terrific performance with ROS on a Raspberry Pi 3, but the best bit is that if the performance isn\u2019t enough its easy to make use of additional compute infrastructure because you can make it all work together with ROS.", "To claim that shoving everything on to one central processor solves all problems with timing ain\u2019t so either nor is it particularly true that you must implement heavy weight timing synchronization mechanisms for every peripheral.", "Personally I love ROS just like I love my car. Now if I am more familiar with a horse and buggy, it might seem a lot easier to use and a reasonable choice, because its true that cars have their own set of problems. However in the end the advantages of my car over more traditional modes of transport are just overwhelming and any problems that currently exist with cars are being worked on by a vast worldwide group of talented engineers. I don\u2019t see that kind of engineering happening with my horse and buggy approach.", "I think that the author has missed an important benefit of ROS for developers of robot applications: the tools.", "The author is building a robot with only concern for the hardware and the low-level embedded software that drives it. This is a use case that ROS is not particularly well suited for. They can be considered correct in arguing that ROS is not for them. (ROS 2 is, or perhaps will be, a different story.)", "But for someone building an application on top of a robot platform, ROS offers something very important: an integrated tool chain with many different tools that can help you design, introspect and debug your software. This may not be relevant when building the hardware-driving embedded software (or it might be, depending on how you work), but it is very relevant when you are dealing with complex data flows and data-processing or planning algorithms that need debugging but aren\u2019t easy to debug when the output is a wall of numbers. Having tools like rosbag and rviz and rqt_* available can massively reduce the difficulty in developing robot software.", "I\u2019m not with a company, but a comment I have heard several times from people who are is that this is the value they get from ROS. They don\u2019t use it because there are lots of existing nodes available (another comment is often that they don\u2019t want those nodes because they are not reliable enough to go into a product).

It should be seen by package maintainers as a place to shake down their packages before they go into an LTS release. While at the start of a cycle this would probably involve lots of new features being introduced and APIs broken, over time the package would stabilise and bugs would be wrung out (while still providing room for new features if desired). The reason I think this is a benefit is that it gives users of the LTS release more confidence that the software has been well used before release rather than just being the head of the repository dropped in before the release goes out. If the wringing out happens before release then a company has to do less wringing out of their own before using the release in a product.", "As you mention, this is closer to the Debian model, and has similar benefits along the testing/unstable/stable axis.

I think that Debian\u2019s use of its own bug tracker for all its packages is an aide to this for them. They can easily check how many open tickets a package has and what type they are. It\u2019s possible that some of the work coming out of the current quality assurance effort might provide something that can be used here. For example, the CI badge functionality can be used to automatically check that a package has CI, and is passing that CI, before it gets accepted into the LTS release.", "But as you say, ultimately with the current nature of the ROS community, trusting the maintainers is necessary.", "Overall, I\u2019m not usually a huge fan of prolonged testing cycles.

Is the LTS release intended to be a stable platform for products to be built on and for use in critical applications, or is it a snapshot of package versions at a point in time that may be updated as package maintainers feel like it?", "Put another way, does the OSRF see its position as like the Linux kernel developers, who release new kernels regularly but do not pay much attention to the testing necessary to ensure usability in critical applications and leave the production of releases for critical applications to others (the Debians and Red Hats), or does the OSRF see itself as like the Debian Foundation, providing a well-tested base on which applications can be built?", "I\u2019m not criticising either position because both are perfectly valid, it just needs to be clear.

Interaction at the international level is one of the greatest things about open source software for me.", "Having said that, the concept of local events held in the local language is as old as open source itself. I have seen events held in Japan in Japanese for projects as large and diverse as HTML5, Firefox and Google\u2019s various projects. These sorts of events are important because not everyone can speak English with the level of confidence necessary to participant actively in the global community. Local events allow those who can to provide information of new projects and trends, and knowledge of using or contributing to a project, to those who can\u2019t get this information directly in English.", "The concept of local/local-language events is not new to ROS, either. Although ROSCon JP is the first to be officially licensed by the OSRF, there have been numerous events in the past. The biggest example I can think of is the ROS summer camp that has been held annually in China for several years now. They get several hundred participants and I don\u2019t think they are doing it in English. In Japan, we have had informal Japanese-language events for several years now.", "The reason we are working with the OSRF for ROSCon JP is to create a central event for the local community in the same way that the international ROSCon has become a central event for the global ROS community. It allows us to make the scale much bigger than an informal event can be. Being officially licensed by the OSRF helps us to attract sponsors, which in turn lets us do things that cost money but are important, like provide exhibition space, bring in valuable overseas speakers (with translators), get a high-quality logo by the same artist as the main ROSCon logo, provide food, record the talks and archive them online, etc. All these contribute to making the event memorable, which in turn makes it valuable as a means to motivate the local community to participate in a project that does not have that much information available in Japanese, as well as motivate the community to grow itself organically. As with ROSCon, ROSCon JP is a by-the-community-for-the-community event.", "Having the OSRF on board has meant that we are getting valuable organising support from the organisers of ROSCon, we get a set of rules and guidelines to guide us in planning an event that meets their standards (these have been much more useful than you might think), we get to use the ROSCon trademark, and additional things like use of the OSRF video archive site for the talk recordings (so we don\u2019t have to do that ourselves).", "I don\u2019t want to speak for the OSRF, but my understanding is that for them having a local event that is licensed means they can control how the ROS and ROSCon branding is used, ensuring that the event meets their standards. We are effectively their test case for them to figure out how to do this, and if we can make our event a success then I think you will see more OSRF-backed local events in non-English speaking countries in the future.", "I too want to ensure that ROS remains strong on international cooperation. I see this sort of local-language event as an important part of that, providing a local feeder to the wider community in order to attract people to it who ordinarily would not have a way to begin participating.", "Speaking as a ROSCon co-organizer/co-author of the local-language strategy\u2026What Geoff said ", "I think that is best if anyone can speak fluently English , after all English is the world language , instead of Japanese , or Chinese , French , even Deustch, so if you want to communicate with your guy in Japan , Japanese is enough ,", "\nbut ROSCon is world event , I insist we should or have to speak English fluently ,  so , learning English , guy", "I think having local ROSCon (affiliated with the Open Source Robotics Foundation to keep track of what is being shown/discussed for the benefit of all the community) is a very good thing.

I\u2019d like to add some context to the discussion.", "Open Robotics would not exist today without the support of the US Department of Defense (DOD). Back at Willow Garage around 2010-2011 we often talked about creating a separate organization to specifically focus on open source development of ROS & Gazebo. What was missing was a way to fund such an organization. A contract from DARPA to develop simulation software for the forthcoming DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC) allowed us to leave Willow and start OSRF in 2012. We were helped by a generous donation from Willow to cover our initial operating expenses, but it was the DRC contract that made it possible to build a team and create a sustainable organization around it. The DRC program alone supported ~10 people working on Gazebo and related projects for more than 3 years.", "When Willow was winding down in early 2013, we were able to hire the core ROS team and thereby take responsibility for ROS itself only because of a grant that we had through the National Robotics Initiative. The grant was 1/3 funded by the US Army, with the rest funded equally by NASA and the National Science Foundation (NSF). Taken together that funding supported ~4 people for 3 years to maintain ROS and to start work on ROS 2.", "It\u2019s impossible to know for sure, but it\u2019s reasonable to wonder whether ROS and/or Gazebo would have become orphaned projects had we not received that DOD funding at that time. Perhaps the community or another organization would have picked them up. But in my opinion, probably not.", "Since that time we\u2019ve worked (and continue to work) on a number of DOD-funded programs from various agencies. We\u2019ve never tried to hide that support; you can find 4 DOD agency logos on our ", ". We\u2019ve also never tried to hide the work that we do for those agencies. Quite the opposite: in all these programs the code and documentation that we develop is 100% open source. To my mind, that\u2019s the best possible use of public money that\u2019s paying for R&D: build technology that can be used by everyone, everywhere.", "In addition, the fact that our government funding, DOD and otherwise, is all channeled into open source products has an important consequence: we cannot work on anything that is classified or subject to export control. As you might imagine, this constraint rules out pretty much anything related to weapons or other offensive technology. We go further, judging each potential project based on the apparent intent of the people running the program and the likely application of the technology. Over the years we have declined many funding opportunities because we found them to disagree with our personal and organizational principles.", "Of course it would be naive in the extreme to imagine that technology that we develop and release won\u2019t ever be used in a manner that we disagree with.

In 2013 government funding, primarily from DOD, made up more than 85% of our funding. In 2017 that figure was less than 25%. In the future could we move completely away from government funding? Perhaps, but it\u2019s worth considering all the implications: while we\u2019re very grateful for the support of our industry sponsors, they generally (and understandably) are asking us for near-term improvements and releases that will support their product or service offerings. Those priorities are vital to keep us grounded in the needs of today, but it\u2019s primarily government R&D programs that give us the time and flexibility to take on bigger, riskier, more speculative projects. And in the US, those programs are primarily funded by DOD. I\u2019d prefer to see agencies like NSF have a larger budget, but I\u2019m not in a position to make that happen.", "It\u2019s worth noting that this debate is an old one.

", "In the absence of a shim (I don\u2019t know whether that is possible or not, but for the sake of this question assume it isn\u2019t), what about a migration tool or script to do 80+% of the migration effort? Would that help ease the transition?", "I agree with Martin. As a company building solutions based on ROS 1, porting all of our code base to a new middleware would be a major effort. Our robots perform mobile picking in warehouses, where performance and reliability demands require a well-understood system. Exchanging the foundation of this very complex system and getting to a similar performance level again will not be an easy step.", "And even if there was a script for doing many of the basic steps, the real work begins afterwards when you discover and fix all the bugs related to a different communication model, bugs in the still fresh and mildly tested libraries, in core components etc that often only appear after long-term operation (cf. some of the bugs in roscore my colleagues have reported and fixed)", "Since many of the new features of ROS 2 are not really required for our use case, we would have to decide whether it makes more sense for us to migrate, or to fork and build, in addition to our own packages, also the required ROS core packages. The latter would definitely not be my preferred outcome, and I hope that we can find either a good migration path or ways for maintaining both versions for a longer time.", "I\u2019m coming late to the discussion here, but it seems like there are a couple points that are being conflated.

However, I also agree with ", " that not releasing another LTS after Melodic doesn\u2019t kill ROS next year.  Much of my lab is still on Indigo because some of our robots are locked to particular ROS version, and the pain of upgrading outweighs the lack of recency of our version.  If there were no more releases after Indigo, I wouldn\u2019t have cared.  Of course, everyone\u2019s use cases are different, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s accurate to say that ROS1 is over if there\u2019s no N-Turtle.  If does, however, start the clock ticking.", "I guess that, for me, it breaks down to the question of \u201cAre the improvements in ROS2 worth the pain of migrating all of my code?\u201d.  We\u2019ve got a lot of code, and that would be a significant pain.  Personally, I think that ROS2 will be better (for me and my students) than ROS1 is, once we get some features in place (looking at you actions and the new nav stack).  Given that we have to upgrade from Indigo next April in any case, I might just bite to bullet and move to ROS2.", "In the end, I think that the question of limited resources might be the most powerful one.  If Open Robotics has N hours to work on ROS, how many should they spend on ROS1 and how many on ROS2.  If we need M hours of work to make ROS2 viable, then the math is simple; more time on ROS1 means a longer time until ROS2 is ready.", "The worst thing we can do is fork.

How many of the emergent bugs in ROS1 were because of code written by grad students that wasn\u2019t properly tested?", "The big question, of course, is whether the new (hopefully) more mature and better-developed parts of ROS2 will dominate the inevitable emergent bugs.  I have no idea, but I\u2019m at least a little optimistic.", "True, a number of components seem better designed, and software engineering practices are used more from the beginning. A problem when porting a complex system built on top is just that the application code, often silently, relies on properties of the communication layers (think for example about when exactly to ask tf for transforms and what to consider beforehand). If such behavior changes (even if it changes to the better), problems will appear.", "That\u2019s probably the crux of it; how many of these implicit assumptions will surface, and how long will they take to find and fix.  I guess that\u2019s an argument for both never moving to ROS2 (so we don\u2019t have to deal with it) and moving to ROS2 immediately (so we don\u2019t write any more code that relies on ROS1 idiosyncrasies).  :-/", "Powered by ", ", best viewed with JavaScript enabled"], "thread_details": ["\n", "\n", "\n", "\n", "\n", "\n"], "url": "https://discourse.ros.org/t/discussion-on-ros-to-ros2-transition-plan/6155"},

{"title": "Fiducial Marker Based Localization System - Package Annoucement", "thread_contents": ["Hello Fellow ROS Users and Developers,", "We are excited to announce our fiducial based localization system ", ".", "We love current LIDAR based localization methods, however they require expensive LIDAR for good results. LIDAR methods are also subject to the \u201ckidnapped robot problem\u201d which is the inability to unambiguously localize ", " in spaces which have a similar layout (e.g. if you move your robot to one of many similar offices it will get lost). Common LIDAR localization packages like amcl need to be initialized with a pose estimate on every run, something that can be difficult to do accurately. LIDAR based methods can also be difficult to tune and set up.", "Our fiducial localization system enables a robot with a camera to engage in robust unequivocal localization based on pre-placed fiducial markers. The node simultaneously maps and localizes with these markers, and is robust against movements of single fiducials. This robustness is due to the fact that it continuously recomputes both the map of fiducials and the error associated with each fiducial. It then computes the reliability of each fiducial based on the estimate error of each fiducial. The required sensor is inexpensive and the method is relatively simple to set up. We use the Raspberry Pi Camera V2 ($25), but any calibrated camera with a ROS driver will work.", "Here is a screenshot of rviz visualizing the fiducial map:", "\n", "This localization method may be used stand-alone or it can be used as a compliment to more traditional LIDAR methods to create unambiguous localization at all times, using a system like ", ".", "For creating and detecting fiducial markers we use OpenCV\u2019s ArUco module.", "\nMore about operation and usage can be found on the ", "Have an issue, or an idea for improvement?

RViz markers are always a great addition.", "Have you quantified the position accuracy with the Pi camera? Presumably it depends on how many markers are visible, but are we talking cm or mm here? One other thing, the convention for visible/invisible markers seems flipped to me - I would think that visible markers should be green in RViz, and out-of-frame ones red.", "I can see a lot of uses cases for this.

The biggest problem is noise in the pose estimates of single fiducials, as a couple pixels of noise can change the angular estimate wildly.", "We have a method in the works that instead of doing individual marker pose estimates, does a more sophisticated approach using a single pose estimate on all the detected marker vertices. We want to have the data set and testing to measure if it is actually an improvement before merging though.", "Rohan", "You were right about the license, I don\u2019t get too many people looking at the work, so it was never much of a concern.

I don\u2019t want to hijack your thread any more than I have.", "I had a little bit more of a look through your code, but it was a bit rushed so forgive me if I missed it, do you make any assumptions about marker placement? I found that it really helped my estimations during the marker pose estimate step to have an option to allow aligning the marker with a plane.", "As a lot of the use cases for your markers may be on a single ceiling of constant height, it\u2019s relatively easy to project the marker estimate from the camera such that you can take the pose at the intersection with the common plane. Not sure how the SLAM methods work with this, but it may be worth considering if you haven\u2019t already!", "We do not make any assumptions about marker placement. We have a \u201c2d\u201d mode that assumes that the robot is on a flat plane, and only moves in linear x, y and rotational z.", "We used to use a system that made a lot more assumptions, such as a constant height flat ceiling, but minor variations from this assumption caused the pose estimations to be unstable, and going to 6DOF solved this issue, as well as providing much more flexibility in marker placement (allowing for sloped ceilings, and even placing markers on walls).", "Yes we have characterized the accuracy as Rohan says in normal conditions its good to a couple cm. Our system dynamically computes the accuracy based on the accuracy of all the markers it can see and combines the poses from all the visible markers in making its estimate. If you increase the density of markers the accuracy will improve but it is a n^0.5 process. Moving markers closer to the robot will also increase accuracy as will increasing their size.", "Its important to note that the size of the fiducial can be determined both in principle and practice to less than 1 pixel, based on fitting lines to the edge of the aruco marker square, a pattern that crosses many pixels. Signal to noise and sensible lighting is important to get decent results here.", "The results that we are getting are good for most of the applications we use, that doesn\u2019t mean we aren\u2019t going to continue to improve it.

When handling ROS packages and nodes, it can help you do a lot of work under the hood, eliminating the hassle of typing commands and manually modifying files.

Now for live operation on a robot that is fine. However when developing or testing, there is often the desire to run a recorded dataset through the pipeline as fast as possible and in a deterministic way. Doing this with a node graph and rosbag play is difficult. Playing back the bag file too fast might result in overflowing queues and playing it back to slowly you don\u2019t crunch the numbers as fast as you could.

Here is a shortlist :", "linearizability : all messages received by a process (node) should be ordered in a queue before doing anything else. This requires extra effort as it is not supported  ( or at least api is not exposed ? ) in ROS. This also allows replaying messages received by a node (from the receiver view point, not like rosbag, which does it from a sender viewpoint). But that also means that the node relies only on messages received ( not clock, or data in a file somewhere, etc. ) otherwise they are other things to record and replay. Luckily anything ( I think ) can be modeled as a list of messages received at a certain time.", "one thread per node. One needs to make sure the multithreading in a node introduced by ros ( services, topics ) do not have any side effect ( nothing modified outside the callback ). This could maybe be enforced with an extension ?

This ensure a possible deterministice replay later, providing that all inputs in the system is a message. Ideally it should also be the one telling a node to loop another time, so that node state can be saved before and after. This is where you can have a \u201cdebug\u201d/\u201crelease\u201d distinction, where release would spin as fast as possible ( possibly dropping fairness and determinacy, but these might be addressable by putting a few sleeps here and there, and avoiding accumulators\u2026 which is still humanly possible to find and fix )", "I think these are the main points\u2026", "\nActor Model : one thread, one mailbox.

Whenever rosbag sends out a message the queue filling counter for the corresponding node is decreased. When the corresponding subscriber actually processes a received message it signals a free slot in the input queue by a service call to rosbag. If one of the monitored queues is full, rosbag automatically pauses playback until the corresponding node signals a free queue slot again.

The ", " (version 0.4) doesn\u2019t actually provide any insight into what is expected of a given applicant, it just says to send an email. Do you expect that initial email to contain all the contributions to be judged as well as the story of what the applicant is looking to accomplish on the steering committee? Or are you going to crawl through all ROS repos looking for commits from our email addresses (in which case, what is a \u201cROS repo\u201d and how did you determine our email addresses)? Neither seem ideal.", "Additionally, are there guidelines for what the contributions should be? As an example, I expect that our contributions to SROS 2 would count, but off-hand I\u2019d say our contributions to Fast RTPS would not as it\u2019s not a ROS-specific project. However, given that eProsima is a member of the steering committee, I expect that assumption would be wrong. In that case, do our contributions to support ROS 2 in Snapcraft count toward this? If we were a company creating a robot that runs ROS 2, does that count?", "I don\u2019t mean to call anyone out here, I think all the current members are excellent, I\u2019m just saying these lines to external observers look very fuzzy, and guidelines for what counts toward the steering committee members\u2019 FTE don\u2019t seem to exist.

You\u2019re right in pointing out that the lines are fuzzy, and these are among the issues that we\u2019re working through right now. We aim to be as fair and as transparent as possible, but I also want to avoid unwittingly constraining ourselves with rules that won\u2019t age well.", "E.g., it was suggested early on that we enumerate the set of repositories that count as being valid destinations for ROS 2 contributions. I argued against that idea because I don\u2019t believe that any such enumeration will stand the test of time. In exchange we have the question you\u2019ve raised, which is what should count?", "You\u2019re right that FastRTPS isn\u2019t strictly part of ROS 2, but given the critical role that it plays as a dependency in the ROS 2 ecosystem (not to mention that (I\u2019m guessing) ROS 2 is the most significant use case for FastRTPS), I would consider contributions to FastRTPS to be helping ROS 2.
